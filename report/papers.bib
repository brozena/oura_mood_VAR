	abstract = {The effects of stress may be alleviated when its impact or a decreased stress-resilience are detected early. This study explores whether wearable-measured sleep and resting HRV in police officers can be predicted by stress-related Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) measures in preceding days and predict stress-related EMA outcomes in subsequent days. Eight police officers used an Oura ring to collect daily Total Sleep Time (TST) and resting Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and an EMA app for measuring demands, stress, mental exhaustion, and vigor during 15–55 weeks. Vector Autoregression (VAR) models were created and complemented by Granger causation tests and Impulse Response Function visualizations. Demands negatively predicted TST and HRV in one participant. TST negatively predicted demands, stress, and mental exhaustion in two, three, and five participants, respectively, and positively predicted vigor in five participants. HRV negatively predicted demands in two participants, and stress and mental exhaustion in one participant. Changes in HRV lasted longer than those in TST. Bidirectional associations of TST and resting HRV with stress-related outcomes were observed at a weak-to-moderate strength, but not consistently across participants. TST and resting HRV are more consistent predictors of stress-resilience in upcoming days than indicators of stress-related measures in prior days.},

	abstract = {Background: Affective states are important aspects of healthy functioning; as such, monitoring and understanding affect is necessary for the assessment and treatment of mood-based disorders. Recent advancements in wearable technologies have increased the use of such tools in detecting and accurately estimating mental states (eg, affect, mood, and stress), offering comprehensive and continuous monitoring of individuals over time.
Objective: Previous attempts to model an individual’s mental state relied on subjective measurements or the inclusion of only a few objective monitoring modalities (eg, smartphones). This study aims to investigate the capacity of monitoring affect using fully objective measurements. We conducted a comparatively long-term (12-month) study with a holistic sampling of participants’ moods, including 20 affective states.
Methods: Longitudinal physiological data (eg, sleep and heart rate), as well as daily assessments of affect, were collected using 3 modalities (ie, smartphone, watch, and ring) from 20 college students over a year. We examined the difference between the distributions of data collected from each modality along with the differences between their rates of missingness. Out of the 20 participants, 7 provided us with 200 or more days’ worth of data, and we used this for our predictive modeling setup. Distributions of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) among the 7 selected participants were observed. For predictive modeling, we assessed the performance of different machine learning models, including random forests (RFs), support vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). We also investigated the capability of each modality in predicting mood and the most important features of PA and NA RF models.
Results: RF was the best-performing model in our analysis and performed mood and stress (nervousness) prediction with {\textasciitilde}81\% and {\textasciitilde}72\% accuracy, respectively. PA models resulted in better performance compared to NA. The order of the most important modalities in predicting PA and NA was the smart ring, phone, and watch, respectively. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis showed that sleep and activity-related features were the most impactful in predicting PA and NA.
Conclusions: Generic machine learning–based affect prediction models, trained with population data, outperform existing methods, which use the individual’s historical information. Our findings indicated that our mood prediction method outperformed the existing methods. Additionally, we found that sleep and activity level were the most important features for predicting next-day PA and NA, respectively.},

	abstract = {Background: Depression and anxiety are leading causes of disability worldwide but often remain undetected and untreated. Smartphone and wearable devices may offer a unique source of data to detect moment by moment changes in risk factors associated with mental disorders that overcome many of the limitations of traditional screening methods.Objective: The current study aimed to explore the extent to which data from smartphone and wearable devices could predict symptoms of depression and anxiety.Methods: A total of N = 60 adults (ages 24–68) who owned an Apple iPhone and Oura Ring were recruited online over a 2-week period. At the beginning of the study, participants installed the Delphi data acquisition app on their smartphone. The app continuously monitored participants' location (using GPS) and smartphone usage behavior (total usage time and frequency of use). The Oura Ring provided measures related to activity (step count and metabolic equivalent for task), sleep (total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and time in bed) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, participants were prompted to report their daily mood (valence and arousal). Participants completed self-reported assessments of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21) at baseline, midpoint and the end of the study.Results: Multilevel models demonstrated a significant negative association between the variability of locations visited and symptoms of depression (beta = −0.21, p = 0.037) and significant positive associations between total sleep time and depression (beta = 0.24, p = 0.023), time in bed and depression (beta = 0.26, p = 0.020), wake after sleep onset and anxiety (beta = 0.23, p = 0.035) and HRV and anxiety (beta = 0.26, p = 0.035). A combined model of smartphone and wearable features and self-reported mood provided the strongest prediction of depression.Conclusion: The current findings demonstrate that wearable devices may provide valuable sources of data in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety, most notably data related to common measures of sleep.},
