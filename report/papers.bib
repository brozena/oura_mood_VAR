	abstract = {Objective To understand self-monitoring strategies used independently of clinical treatment by individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), in order to recommend technology design principles to support mental health management.Materials and Methods Participants with BD (N = 552) were recruited through the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, the International Bipolar Foundation, and WeSearchTogether.org to complete a survey of closed- and open-ended questions. In this study, we focus on descriptive results and qualitative analyses.Results Individuals reported primarily self-monitoring items related to their bipolar disorder (mood, sleep, finances, exercise, and social interactions), with an increasing trend towards the use of digital tracking methods observed. Most participants reported having positive experiences with technology-based tracking because it enables self-reflection and agency regarding health management and also enhances lines of communication with treatment teams. Reported challenges stem from poor usability or difficulty interpreting self-tracked data.Discussion Two major implications for technology-based self-monitoring emerged from our results. First, technologies can be designed to be more condition-oriented, intuitive, and proactive. Second, more automated forms of digital symptom tracking and intervention are desired, and our results suggest the feasibility of detecting and predicting emotional states from patterns of technology usage. However, we also uncovered tension points, namely that technology designed to support mental health can also be a disruptor.Conclusion This study provides increased understanding of self-monitoring practices, attitudes, and needs of individuals with bipolar disorder. This knowledge bears implications for clinical researchers and practitioners seeking insight into how individuals independently self-manage their condition as well as for researchers designing monitoring technologies to support mental health management.},

	abstract = {Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a complex, cyclical and chronic mental illness where self-tracking is central to self-management. Mobile technology is often leveraged to support this. Limited research has investigated the everyday practices of self-tracking for BD, and it is unclear how the normative ontology that is seen in existing self-tracking technology discourses (e.g. the Quantifed Self movement) is applicable to the domain of mental health. Combining principles of Patient and Public Involvement (PPI)—a staple research design principle in mental healthcare—with design and HCI-oriented research approaches, we conducted interviews and workshops with people with lived experience of BD to explore reasons and methods for self-tracking, and challenges and opportunities for technology. Our results describe recommendations for the design of self-tracking mental health technology. We also refect upon the complex role of researchers working at the intersection of emerging mental health technologies, the principles of PPI, and HCI research.},

	abstract = {Background
Self-management (SM) is increasingly emphasised as a key aspect of bipolar disorder (BD) treatment. However, little is known about the subjective experience of SM, which might have both positive and negative impacts. The present study aimed to advance this literature through qualitative investigation of the experiences of people with BD who participated in an SM intervention targeting quality of life (QoL).
Methods
Forty-three individuals with BD engaged with an SM intervention and were later questioned about personal experiences of engagement with the intervention, including attempts to enact self-management strategies. Thematic analysis was used to identify important aspects of the experience of SM in BD.
Results
Four themes describing people's experiences of SM were identified: 1) SM for BD is empowering, 2) individual responsibility to self-manage BD, 3) SM strategies lack power to control BD, and 4) the relationship of SM to the healthcare system.
Limitations
Potential limitations to generalisability may occur from self-selection bias in favour of SM and the QoL-focused nature of the present intervention.
Conclusions
The findings of this research generate novel insights into ways in which individuals with BD engage with SM interventions. For most people with BD, SM invokes a sense of empowerment and responsibility, although some feel symptoms remain beyond their control. A sense of partnership between consumers and clinicians may emerge from attention to SM, but traditional medical approaches were perceived as neglecting this aspect of care. Considerations from consumer perspectives are presented to assist clinicians and researchers utilising SM interventions in BD.},

This study explores whether wearable-measured sleep and resting HRV in police officers can be predicted by stress-related Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) measures in preceding days and predict stress-related EMA outcomes in subsequent days. Eight police officers used an Oura ring to collect daily Total Sleep Time (TST) and resting Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and an EMA app for measuring demands, stress, mental exhaustion, and vigor during 15–55 weeks. Vector Autoregression (VAR) models were created and complemented by Granger causation tests and Impulse Response Function visualizations. Demands negatively predicted TST and HRV in one participant. TST negatively predicted demands, stress, and mental exhaustion in two, three, and five participants, respectively, and positively predicted vigor in five participants. HRV negatively predicted demands in two participants, and stress and mental exhaustion in one participant. Changes in HRV lasted longer than those in TST. Bidirectional associations of TST and resting HRV with stress-related outcomes were observed at a weak-to-moderate strength, but not consistently across participants. TST and resting HRV are more consistent predictors of stress-resilience in upcoming days than indicators of stress-related measures in prior days.},

	abstract = {Background: Affective states are important aspects of healthy functioning; as such, monitoring and understanding affect is necessary for the assessment and treatment of mood-based disorders. Recent advancements in wearable technologies have increased the use of such tools in detecting and accurately estimating mental states (eg, affect, mood, and stress), offering comprehensive and continuous monitoring of individuals over time.
Objective: Previous attempts to model an individual’s mental state relied on subjective measurements or the inclusion of only a few objective monitoring modalities (eg, smartphones). This study aims to investigate the capacity of monitoring affect using fully objective measurements. We conducted a comparatively long-term (12-month) study with a holistic sampling of participants’ moods, including 20 affective states.
Methods: Longitudinal physiological data (eg, sleep and heart rate), as well as daily assessments of affect, were collected using 3 modalities (ie, smartphone, watch, and ring) from 20 college students over a year. We examined the difference between the distributions of data collected from each modality along with the differences between their rates of missingness. Out of the 20 participants, 7 provided us with 200 or more days’ worth of data, and we used this for our predictive modeling setup. Distributions of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) among the 7 selected participants were observed. For predictive modeling, we assessed the performance of different machine learning models, including random forests (RFs), support vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). We also investigated the capability of each modality in predicting mood and the most important features of PA and NA RF models.
Results: RF was the best-performing model in our analysis and performed mood and stress (nervousness) prediction with {\textasciitilde}81\% and {\textasciitilde}72\% accuracy, respectively. PA models resulted in better performance compared to NA. The order of the most important modalities in predicting PA and NA was the smart ring, phone, and watch, respectively. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis showed that sleep and activity-related features were the most impactful in predicting PA and NA.
Conclusions: Generic machine learning–based affect prediction models, trained with population data, outperform existing methods, which use the individual’s historical information. Our findings indicated that our mood prediction method outperformed the existing methods. Additionally, we found that sleep and activity level were the most important features for predicting next-day PA and NA, respectively.},

	abstract = {Background: Depression and anxiety are leading causes of disability worldwide but often remain undetected and untreated. Smartphone and wearable devices may offer a unique source of data to detect moment by moment changes in risk factors associated with mental disorders that overcome many of the limitations of traditional screening methods.Objective: The current study aimed to explore the extent to which data from smartphone and wearable devices could predict symptoms of depression and anxiety.Methods: A total of N = 60 adults (ages 24–68) who owned an Apple iPhone and Oura Ring were recruited online over a 2-week period. At the beginning of the study, participants installed the Delphi data acquisition app on their smartphone. The app continuously monitored participants' location (using GPS) and smartphone usage behavior (total usage time and frequency of use). The Oura Ring provided measures related to activity (step count and metabolic equivalent for task), sleep (total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and time in bed) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, participants were prompted to report their daily mood (valence and arousal). Participants completed self-reported assessments of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21) at baseline, midpoint and the end of the study.Results: Multilevel models demonstrated a significant negative association between the variability of locations visited and symptoms of depression (beta = −0.21, p = 0.037) and significant positive associations between total sleep time and depression (beta = 0.24, p = 0.023), time in bed and depression (beta = 0.26, p = 0.020), wake after sleep onset and anxiety (beta = 0.23, p = 0.035) and HRV and anxiety (beta = 0.26, p = 0.035). A combined model of smartphone and wearable features and self-reported mood provided the strongest prediction of depression.Conclusion: The current findings demonstrate that wearable devices may provide valuable sources of data in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety, most notably data related to common measures of sleep.},

	abstract = {Background
Patients undergoing continuous vital sign monitoring (heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR], pulse oximetry [SpO2]) in real time display inter-related vital sign changes during situations of physiologic stress. Patterns in this physiological cross-talk could portend impending cardiorespiratory instability (CRI). Vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling with Granger causality tests is one of the most flexible ways to elucidate underlying causal mechanisms in time series data.

Purpose
The purpose of this article is to illustrate development of patient-specific VAR models using vital sign time series (VSTS) data in a sample of acutely ill, monitored, step-down unit (SDU) patients, and determine their Granger causal dynamics prior to onset of an incident CRI.

Approach
CRI was defined as vital signs beyond stipulated normality thresholds (HR = 40–140/minute, RR = 8–36/minute, SpO2 {\textless} 85\%) and persisting for 3 minutes within a 5-minute moving window (60\% of the duration of the window). A 6-hour time segment prior to onset of first CRI was chosen for time series modeling in 20 patients using a six-step procedure: (a) the uniform time series for each vital sign was assessed for stationarity; (b) appropriate lag was determined using a lag-length selection criteria; (c) the VAR model was constructed; (d) residual autocorrelation was assessed with the Lagrange Multiplier test; (e) stability of the VAR system was checked; and (f) Granger causality was evaluated in the final stable model.

Results
The primary cause of incident CRI was low SpO2 (60\% of cases), followed by out-of-range RR (30\%) and HR (10\%). Granger causality testing revealed that change in RR caused change in HR (21\%) (i.e., RR changed before HR changed) more often than change in HR causing change in RR (15\%). Similarly, changes in RR caused changes in SpO2 (15\%) more often than changes in SpO2 caused changes in RR (9\%). For HR and SpO2, changes in HR causing changes in SpO2 and changes in SpO2 causing changes in HR occurred with equal frequency (18\%).

Discussion
Within this sample of acutely ill patients who experienced a CRI event, VAR modeling indicated that RR changes tend to occur before changes in HR and SpO2. These findings suggest that contextual assessment of RR changes as the earliest sign of CRI is warranted. Use of VAR modeling may be helpful in other nursing research applications based on time series data.},

Sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder are present during all stages of the condition and exert a negative impact on overall course, quality of life, and treatment outcomes. We examine the partnership between circadian system (process C) functioning and sleep–wake homeostasis (process S) on optimal sleep functioning and explore the role of disruptions in both systems on sleep disturbances in bipolar disorder. A convergence of evidence suggests that sleep problems in bipolar disorder result from dysregulation across both process C and process S systems. Biomarkers of depressive episodes include heightened fragmentation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, reduced REM latency, increased REM density, and a greater percentage of awakenings, while biomarkers of manic episodes include reduced REM latency, greater percentage of stage I sleep, increased REM density, discontinuous sleep patterns, shortened total sleep time, and a greater time awake in bed. These findings highlight the importance of targeting novel treatments for sleep disturbance in bipolar disorder.},

Sleep disturbances are frequent warning signs of both mania and depression. This study used cross correlation analysis to characterize the relationship between mood, sleep and bedrest in longitudinal data. Methods: Self-reported mood, sleep and bedrest (mean 169 ± 59 days of data per patient) from 59 outpatients with bipolar disorder receiving standard treatment were analyzed. The cross correlation function was used to determine the latency between the changes in sleep and/or bedrest and mood for time shifts of between –7 and 7 days. Results: For sleep and/or bedrest, a significant inverse correlation was found with the change in mood, most commonly with a time latency of one day. Sleep plus bedrest had the strongest relationship with a change in mood, with a significant correlation in 24 of 59 patients (41\%) for the night before or night of a mood change. The patients with a significant cross-correlation between mood and sleep plus bedrest reported about two thirds of all large sleep changes of {\textgreater}3 h and three fourths of all large mood changes ({\textgreater}20 on 100-unit scale). Patients with a significant cross correlation were more likely to take benzodiazepines. Conclusion: In most patients with a significant cross correlation between sleep and/or bedrest and mood, the mood change occurred on the day following the change in sleep and/or bedrest. Sleep changes from a previous pattern, especially those of more than 3 h, may indicate that a large mood change is imminent.},

	abstract = {Background
Few studies have prospectively examined the relationships of sleep with symptoms and functioning in bipolar disorder.
Methods
The present study examined concurrent and prospective associations between total sleep time (TST) and sleep variability (SV) with symptom severity and functioning in a cohort of DSM-IV bipolar patients (N=468) participating in the National Institute of Mental Health Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), all of whom were recovered at study entry.
Results
Concurrent associations at study entry indicated that shorter TST was associated with increased mania severity, and greater SV was associated with increased mania and depression severity. Mixed-effects regression modeling was used to examine prospective associations in the 196 patients for whom follow-up data were available. Consistent with findings at study entry, shorter TST was associated with increased mania severity, and greater SV was associated with increased mania and depression severity over 12months.
Discussion
These findings highlight the importance of disrupted sleep patterns in the course of bipolar illness.},

Objective: Biological rhythm pathways are highlighted in a number of etiological models of bipolar disorder, and the management of circadian instability appears in consensus treatment guidelines. There are, however, significant conceptual and empirical limitations on our understanding of a hypothesised link between circadian, sleep, and emotion regulation processes in bipolar disorder. The aim of this article is to articulate the limits of scientific knowledge in relation to this hypothesis. Methods: A critical evaluation of various literatures was undertaken. The basic science of circadian and sleep processes, their involvement in normal emotion regulation, and the types of evidence suggesting circadian/sleep involvement in bipolar disorder are reviewed. Results: Multiple lines of evidence suggest that circadian and sleep-wake processes are causally involved in bipolar disorder. These processes demonstrably interact with other neurobiological pathways known to be important in bipolar disorder, but are unique in that they are open to behavioural manipulation. Conclusion: Further research into biological rhythm pathways to bipolar disorder is warranted. Person-environment feedback loops are fundamental to circadian adaptation, and models of circadian pathogenesis (and treatment) should recognize this complexity.},

	abstract = {Objective/Background: To evaluate the performance of a multisensor sleep-tracker (ŌURA ring) against polysomnography (PSG) in measuring sleep and sleep stages. Participants: Forty-one healthy adolescents and young adults (13 females; Age: 17.2 ± 2.4 years). Methods: Sleep data were recorded using the ŌURA ring and standard PSG on a single laboratory overnight. Metrics were compared using Bland-Altman plots and epoch-by-epoch (EBE) analysis. Results: Summary variables for sleep onset latency (SOL), total sleep time (TST), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were not different between ŌURA ring and PSG. PSG-ŌURA discrepancies for WASO were greater in participants with more PSG-defined WASO (p {\textless} .001). Compared with PSG, ŌURA ring underestimated PSG N3 ( 20 min) and overestimated PSG REM ( 17 min; p {\textless} .05). PSG-ŌURA differences for TST and WASO lay within the ≤ 30 min a-priori-set clinically satisfactory ranges for 87.8\% and 85.4\% of the sample, respectively. From EBE analysis, ŌURA ring had a 96\% sensitivity to detect sleep, and agreement of 65\%, 51\%, and 61\%, in detecting “light sleep” (N1), “deep sleep” (N2 + N3), and REM sleep, respectively. Specificity in detecting wake was 48\%. Similarly to PSG-N3 (p {\textless} .001), “deep sleep” detected with the ŌURA ring was negatively correlated with advancing age (p = .001). ŌURA ring correctly categorized 90.9\%, 81.3\%, and 92.9\% into PSG-defined TST ranges of {\textless} 6 hr, 6–7 hr, {\textgreater} 7 hr, respectively. Conclusions: Multisensor sleep trackers, such as the ŌURA ring have the potential for detecting outcomes beyond binary sleep–wake using sources of information in addition to motion. While these first results could be viewed as promising, future development and validation are needed.},
