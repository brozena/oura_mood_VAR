Although digital mental health treatments (DMHTs) are effective interventions for common mental disorders, they have not been widely adopted by the U.S. health care system. National and international expert stakeholders representing health care organizations, insurance companies and payers, employers, patients, researchers, policy makers, health economists, and DMHT companies and the investment community attended two Banbury Forum meetings. The Banbury Forum reviewed the evidence for DMHTs, identified the challenges to successful and sustainable implementation, investigated the factors that contributed to more successful implementation internationally, and developed the following recommendations: guided DMHTs should be offered to all patients experiencing common mental disorders, DMHT products and services should be reimbursable to support integration into the U.S. health care landscape, and an evidence standards framework should be developed to support decision makers in evaluating DMHTs.},

Even with today’s seemingly fast pace of AI breakthroughs, the development of long-promised technologies such as self-driving cars, housekeeping robots, and conversational companions has turned out to be much harder than many people expected. One reason for these repeating cycles is our limited understanding of the nature and complexity of intelligence itself. In this paper I describe four fallacies in common assumptions made by AI researchers, which can lead to overconﬁdent predictions about the ﬁeld. I conclude by discussing the open questions spurred by these fallacies, including the age-old challenge of imbuing machines with humanlike common sense.},

The review sought to identify which factors have been most consistently and reliably indicated, and the mechanisms by which these factors are proposed to contribute to the association between hardship and mental health. Although the review identified that a broad variety of factors have been investigated, skills related to personal agency, self-esteem and coping were most frequently and reliably associated with the relationship between financial hardship and mental health outcomes. Just over half of the studies reviewed concluded that the psychological factor investigated was either eroded by financial hardship, increasing vulnerability to mental health difficulties, or protected mental health by remaining intact despite the effects of financial hardship. The remaining studies found no such effect or did not analyse their data in a manner in which a mechanism of action could be identified. The methodological quality of the research included in the review was variable. The valid and reliable measurement of financial hardship, and conclusions regarding causation due to the use of predominantly cross-sectional design were areas of particular weakness.},

Aims: This study aimed to examine the relationship between finances and mental health in bipolar disorder across two time points. Methods: Fifty-four participants with bipolar disorder in a National Health Service community mental health service completed questionnaires examining financial difficulties, compulsive buying and perceived financial well-being. Questionnaires also measured alcohol dependence, stress, depression, anxiety, past and current manic symptoms. Results: Partial correlations showed correlations over time: depression, anxiety and stress predicted later compulsive buying. Compulsive buying also predicted later anxiety. Lower perceived financial wellness increased anxiety and stress over time. Being on benefits was associated with higher depression and going without items such as clothes was linked to higher depression, stress, anxiety and past hypomanic symptoms. Conclusions: Financial difficulties are related to mental health in bipolar disorder. Poor mental health leads to compulsive buying, whereas worry about finances increases anxiety and stress, with a vicious cycle for anxiety.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine which combination of objectively measured actigraphy parameters best characterizes the sleep-wake cycle of euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) compared with healthy controls (HC). Methods Sixty-one BD cases and 61 matched HC undertook 21 consecutive days of actigraphy. Groups were compared using discriminant function analyses (DFA) that explored dimensions derived from mean values of sleep parameters (Model 1); variability of sleep parameters (2); daytime activity (3); and combined sleep and activity parameters (4). Exploratory within-group analyses examined characteristics associated with misclassification. Results After controlling for depressive symptoms, the combined model (4) correctly classified 75\% cases, while the sleep models (1 and 2) correctly classified 87\% controls. The area under the curve favored the combined model (0.86). Age was significantly associated with misclassification among HC, while a diagnosis of BD-II was associated with an increased risk of misclassifications of cases. Conclusion Including sleep variability and activity parameters alongside measures of sleep quantity improves the characterization of cases of euthymic BD and helps distinguish them from HC. If replicated, the findings indicate that traditional approaches to actigraphy (examining mean values for the standard set of sleep parameters) may represent a suboptimal approach to understanding sleep-wake cycles in BD.},

	abstract = {Objectives Remarkably, the specifics of sleep along the human lineage have been slow to emerge, which is surprising given our distinct mental and behavioral capacity and the importance of sleep for individual health and cognitive performance. Largely due to difficultly of measuring sleep outside a controlled, clinical, and laboratory study in ambulatory individuals, human biologists have yet to undergo a thorough examination of sleep in ecologically diverse settings. Here, I outline the procedures and methods for generating sleep data in a broader ecological context with the goal of facilitating the integration of sleep and circadian analyses into human biology research. Methods I describe the steps involved in participant recruitment, screening by way of survey instruments, and sample collection. In addition to describing field use of the traditional (but invasive) equipment such as the gold-standard application of electroencephalography (EEG), I demonstrate leading-edge noninvasive techniques for biometric devices (ie, wrist-worn actigraphy, ring worn arterial pulsometry) to generate sleep and circadian rhythms data. Results I outline best approaches to process and analyze data—including variables such as sleep duration, 24-hour sleep time (ie, summation of night and day sleep), sleep efficiency, sleep fragmentation, and nonparametric circadian rhythms analysis to quantify circadian amplitude. Finally, I discuss comparative statistical methods that are optimized for the use of time-series data. Conclusions This review serves as an introduction to the best practices for studying sleep-wake patterns in humans—with the goal of standardizing tools for launching new human sleep biology research initiatives across the globe.},

	abstract = {Recurrent mood episodes and subsyndromal mood instability cause substantial disability in patients with bipolar disorder. Early identification of mood episodes enabling timely mood stabilization is an important clinical goal. This study investigates the ability of control chart methodology to predict manic and/or depressive episodes by applying Shewhart’s control rules to weekly self-reported scores from mania and depression questionnaires. Shewhart’s control rules were applied to weekly self-reported scores from the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale (ASRM) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology—Self-Report (QIDS) collected from 2001 to 2012 as part of the OXTEXT programme. Manic and depressive episodes were defined as an ASRM score ≥ 10 or a QIDS score ≥ 15, respectively. An episode-free run-in period of eight consecutive weeks without an episode of either type was used to calibrate control charts. Shewhart’s rules were then applied to follow-up data. Their sensitivity and positive predictive value for predicting manic or depressive episodes within the next 4 weeks were calculated focusing on the first episode. Secondary analyses varying control chart type, length of episode-free run-in period, time frames to evaluate diagnostic accuracy, thresholds defining either manic or depressive episodes, and missing data methods were performed. Data from 146 participants (37\% men) were included. The mean age was 43.4 (SD = 13.3) years. The median follow-up was 10 (IQR 5–40) weeks for mania and 10 (IQR 5–23) weeks for depression. A total of 53 (36\%) participants had a manic episode and 67 (46\%) had a depressive episode. For manic episodes, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of Shewhart’s control rules were 30\% (95\% CI 19–45\%) and 7\% (95\% CI 5–9\%), and for depressive episodes, 33\% (95\% CI 22–46\%) and 9\% (95\% CI 6–12\%), respectively. Results from secondary analyses were similar to these. Tele-monitoring with control rules has the potential to predict about one-third of manic or depressive episodes before they occur, at the cost of a high false positive rate. Given the severe consequences of manic and depressive episodes, this trade-off may be desirable.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder is a mental illness aﬀecting over 1\% of the world’s population. In the course of disease there are episodic ﬂuctuations between diﬀerent mood phases, ranging from depression to manic episodes and mixed states. Early detection and treatment of prodromal symptoms of aﬀective episode recurrence is crucial since it reduces the conversion rates to full-blown illness and decreases the symptoms severity. This can be achieved by monitoring the mood stability with the use of data collected from patients’ smartphones. We provide an illustrative example of the application of control charts to early and reliably generate notiﬁcations about the change of the bipolarity phase. Our charts are designed with the weighted model averaging approaches WAM* and WAMs for the detection of disturbances in the stability of the monitored processes. The models are selected in a novel way using the autocorrelation functions. The proposed approach delivers results that have clear, psychiatric interpretation. Control charts based on weighted model averaging are a promising tool for monitoring patients suﬀering from bipolar disorder, especially in case of limited amount of diagnostic data.},

	abstract = {Objective: Internet (eHealth) and smartphone-based (mHealth) approaches to self-management for bipolar disorder are increasingly common. Evidence-based self-management strategies are available for bipolar disorder and provide a useful framework for reviewing existing eHealth/mHealth programs to determine whether these strategies are supported by current technologies. This review assesses which self-management strategies are most supported by technology. Method: Based on 3 previous studies, 7 categories of self-management strategies related to bipolar disorder were identified, followed by a systematic literature review to identify existing eHealth and mHealth programs for this disorder. Searches were conducted by using PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant peer-reviewed articles published January 2005 to May 2015. eHealth and mHealth programs were summarized and reviewed to identify which of the 7 self-management strategy categories were supported by eHealth or mHealth programs. Results: From 1,654 publications, 15 papers were identified for inclusion. From these, 9 eHealth programs and 2 mHealth programs were identified. The most commonly supported self-management strategy categories were “ongoing monitoring,” “maintaining hope,” “education,” and “planning for and taking action”; the least commonly supported categories were “relaxation” and “maintaining a healthy lifestyle.” eHealth programs appear to provide more comprehensive coverage of self-management strategies compared with mHealth programs. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Both eHealth and mHealth programs present a wide range of self-management strategies for bipolar disorder, although individuals seeking comprehensive interventions might be best served by eHealth programs, while those seeking more condensed and direct interventions might prefer mHealth programs.},

This study used qualitative textual analysis to analyze posts on Reddit™ bipolar discussion boards that dealt with genetics and related topics. All thread titles over 4 years were reviewed (N = 1,800). Genetic risk was often raised in the context of Redditors’ discussions about whether or not to have children. Reproductive decision-making for Redditors with bipolar was complex and influenced by factors from their past, present, and imagined future. These factors coalesced under a summative theme: for adults with bipolar disorder, what was the manageability of parenting a child? Reproductive decisions for individuals with bipolar disorder are complex, and Reddit™ is a novel source of information on their perspectives.},

The commercial sector has already embraced the electronic trails of customers as an enabling tool for guiding consumer behaviour, and analogous efforts are ongoing to monitor and improve the mental health of psychiatric patients. The untargeted collection of digital footprints that may or may not be health orientated comprises a large untapped information resource for epidemiological scale research into psychiatric disorders. Real-time monitoring of mood, sleep and physical and social activity in a substantial portion of the affected population in a naturalistic setting is unprecedented in psychiatry. We propose that digital footprints can provide these measurements from real world setting unobtrusively and in a longitudinal fashion. In this perspective article, we outline the concept of digital footprints and the services and devices that create them, and present examples where digital footprints have been successfully used in research. We then critically discuss the opportunities and fundamental challenges associated digital footprints in psychiatric research, such as collecting data from different sources, analysis, ethical and research design challenges.},

A major question for evolutionary biology is what these diverse systems have in common. Here, we review the full breadth of cooperative systems and find that they frequently rely on enforcement mechanisms that suppress selfish behaviour. We discuss many examples, including the suppression of transposable elements, uniparental inheritance of mitochondria and plastids, anti-cancer mechanisms, reciprocation and punishment in humans and other vertebrates, policing in eusocial insects and partner choice in mutualisms between species. To address a lack of accompanying theory, we develop a series of evolutionary models that show that the enforcement of cooperation is widely predicted. We argue that enforcement is an underappreciated, and often critical, ingredient for cooperation across all scales of biological organization.
The authors of this Review discuss cooperative systems across all biological levels, including genomes, multicellular organisms and societies, and develop mathematical models to argue that enforcement is central to the evolution of cooperation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the metabolic side effects of aripiprazole. Three cases of aripiprazole-induced hypertriglyceridemia are also presented.
DATA SOURCES: A search was conducted of English-language articles and abstracts (meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, naturalistic open-label trials, reviews, and case reports) published up to August 31, 2014, in electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE).
STUDY SELECTION: Free-text and MeSH search keywords included aripiprazole, cholesterol, triglyceride, lipid profile, hyperlipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia and their differing terminations and combinations. The search was supplemented by a manual review of reference lists from the identified publications. Pediatric studies were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION: Twenty-two articles were found and 3 aspects of the metabolic side effects of aripiprazole were reviewed: (1) the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in mentally ill patients prior to any antipsychotic use to highlight the initial predisposition of this group of patients to develop the metabolic syndrome, (2) the prevalence of metabolic changes depending on the choice of antipsychotic (aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics), and (3) metabolic changes reported after switching from an antipsychotic to aripiprazole.
RESULTS: Patients with mental disorders are at high risk for developing dyslipidemia, diabetes, and the full criteria of the metabolic syndrome. Antipsychotic use exacerbates this risk, thus increasing the mortality in this population. Nevertheless, it seems that the risk for these side effects varies with each antipsychotic. Although by and large the literature supports the supposition that aripiprazole causes less metabolic effects than other antipsychotics, we report 3 cases of serious aripiprazole-related dyslipidemia in young subjects.
CONCLUSION: On the basis of these 3 cases, aripiprazole can cause hypertriglyceridemia. Triglyceride levels should be carefully monitored in patients with mental disorders taking aripiprazole.},

	url = {https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37365873},
	abstract = {The transition to young adulthood is often initiated by leaving home for college, where one must face increased academic pressures, form a new social support system, and develop adult-like independence over one’s daily life. Life transitions are often experienced as stressful and can negatively affect behaviors such as sleep and academic performance. Furthermore, experiences of stress and disordered sleep are both cause and consequence of many mental disorders, notably anxiety and depression. Thus, it is important to understand how young adults adapt to college, establish new sleep patterns, and respond to novel academic and social stressors that accompany a time of life transition. This dissertation takes a novel approach to understanding the dynamics of these transitions, aiming to inform theories of how dynamics of human behavior vary in healthy and unhealthy ways. In particular, this dissertation focuses on an individualized approach to better understanding the interrelationships of stress, sleep, and mental health during the course of freshmen year of college. 
This dissertation first reviews the background literature of stress, sleep, and daily affect and motivating the need for individualized approaches to further understand their complex interrelationships (Chapter 1). I then present two pilot studies used to develop and refine a methodology for collecting high-quality, intensive longitudinal data over extended durations and at relatively large scales (Chapter 2), and the specification and validation of a novel individual-level linear model framework that can be used to understand the associations and lead/lag directional relationships of daily measures of objective and subjective sleep quality and the subjective experiences of stress (Chapter 3). I then tested the a priori hypotheses developed from these pilot studies in an independent cohort of 49 freshmen who were tracked continuously for a full academic year as they initially arrived on campus (Chapter 4), and discuss the initial inferences and implications an individualized approach provides to our understanding of stress, sleep, and affect during college life (Chapter 5). 
Evidence from this dissertation indicates an individualized approach reveals idiosyncratic but consistent directional relationships between experienced stress and sleep behaviors, which in turn have clinical implications for student’s mental health outcomes during their freshmen year. Together, this dissertation presents some initial steps towards better understanding an individual’s complex interrelationships between stress, sleep quality, and daily affect, as well as their clinical implications.},

Most practitioners, however, are wary of doing so, or do not know how to navigate this. This paper aims to present a comprehensive framework to assist mental health practi­ tioners when choosing to self-disclose lived experiences. This fra­ mework was created by a working group of academics, clinicians, service users and recovery workers, based on an international pro­ ject investigating self-disclosure among professionals. Results from this project informed the content of this framework, considering theoretical models of supervision to guide development. The Sharing Lived Experiences Framework (SLEF) details six areas for practitioners to consider: Preparedness, Confidence, Competence, Relevance, Comfort and Supervision. The connection between pre­ paredness and supervision is emphasised. Preliminary data on the SLEF indicates that staff felt more able to navigate disclosure after training on this framework. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first comprehensive framework to guide practitioners through the disclosure process; from planning, to in-the-moment considera­ tions, to post-disclosure reflection. Although limited available data exist on clinical utility, the SLEF crucially provides a framework for supervision discussions and guided self-reflection for a full range of practitioners on a range of lived experiences.},

	abstract = {If the thesis in Unlocking the Emotional Brain (UtEB) is even half-right, it may
be one of the most important books that I have read. Written by the
psychotherapists Bruce Ecker, Robin Ticic and Laurel Hulley, it claims to offer
a neuroscience-grounded, comprehensive model of how effective therapy works. In
so doing, it also happens to formulate its theory in terms of belief updating,
helping explain how the brain models the world and what kinds of techniques
allow us to actually change our minds. Furthermore, if UtEB is correct, it also
explains why rationalist techniques such as Internal Double Crux [1 2 3] work.

UtEB’s premise is that much if not most of our behavior is driven by emotional
learning. Intense emotions generate unconscious predictive models of how the
world functions and what caused those emotions to occur. The brain then uses
those models to guide our future behavior. Emotional issues and seemingly
irrational behaviors are generated from implicit world-models (schemas) which
have been formed in response to various external challenges. Each schema
contains memories relating to times when the challenge has been encountered and
mental structures describing both the problem and a solution to it.

According to the authors, the key for updating such schemas involves a process
of memory reconsolidation, originally identified in neuroscience. The emotional
brain’s learnings are usually locked and not modifiable. However, once an
emotional schema is activated, it is possible to simultaneously bring into
awareness knowledge contradicting the active schema. When this happens, the
information contained in the schema can be overwritten by the new knowledge.

While I am not convinced that the authors are entirely right, many of the book’s
claims definitely feel like they are pointing in the right direction. I will
discuss some of my caveats and reservations after summarizing some of the book’s
claims in general. I also consider its model in the light of an issu},

	abstract = {Background: Information technology has shifted paper-based documentation in the health care sector into a digital form, in which patient information is transferred electronically from one place to another. However, there remain challenges and issues to resolve in this domain owing to the lack of proper standards, the growth of new technologies (mobile devices, tablets, ubiquitous computing), and health care providers who are reluctant to share patient information. Therefore, a solid systematic literature review was performed to understand the use of this new technology in the health care sector. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive systematic literature reviews that focus on Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based electronic health records (EHRs). In addition, FHIR is the latest standard, which is in an infancy stage of development. Therefore, this is a hot research topic with great potential for further research in this domain.
Objective: The main aim of this study was to explore and perform a systematic review of the literature related to FHIR, including the challenges, implementation, opportunities, and future FHIR applications.
Methods: In January 2020, we searched articles published from January 2012 to December 2019 via all major digital databases in the field of computer science and health care, including ACM, IEEE Explorer, Springer, Google Scholar, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. We identified 8181 scientific articles published in this field, 80 of which met our inclusion criteria for further consideration.
Results: The selected 80 scientific articles were reviewed systematically, and we identified open questions, challenges, implementation models, used resources, beneficiary applications, data migration approaches, and goals of FHIR.
Conclusions: The literature analysis performed in this systematic review highlights the important role of FHIR in the health care domain in the near future.},

Methods A comprehensive search of major electronic databases was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adjunctive MoArm that included patients with bipolar I (BP-I) or bipolar II (BP-II) depression. Data for response/remission and all-cause discontinuation were analyzed. Effect size was summarized by relative risk (RR) using a random effect model. Results Of 58 studies, five RCTs (N = 795 drug, N = 792 placebo) met inclusion criteria. Four armodafinil studies included only BP-I patients and one modafinil study included both bipolar subtypes with limited heterogeneity (I2 = 34\%, P = .19; I2 = 18\%, P = .30). Compared to placebo, augmentation with MoArm was associated with significantly greater rates of treatment response (RR, 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.37; P = .03) and remission (RR, 1.38; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.73; P = .005). All-cause discontinuation was not different than placebo (RR, 1.08; 95\% CI, 0.89-1.30; P = .45) with no evidence of increased risk of mood switch or suicide attempts with MoArm (RR, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.39-2.5; P = .98; RR, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.37-2.85; P = .97). Conclusion This narrower scope meta-analysis of one drug for one disease suggests that adjunctive MoArm may represent a novel therapeutic intervention. Further studies delineating the subtypes of bipolar depression responsive to these novel dopaminergic-enhancing agents are encouraged.},

This book describes special mathematical tricks and techniques which are geared towards exploring the internal structures of time series data and generating powerful descriptive and predictive insights. Also, the book is full of real-life examples of time series and their analyses using cutting-edge solutions developed in Python.The book starts with descriptive analysis to create insightful visualizations of internal structures such as trend, seasonality and autocorrelation. Next, the statistical methods of dealing with autocorrelation and non-stationary time series are described. This is followed by exponential smoothing to produce meaningful insights from noisy time series data. At this point, we shift focus towards predictive analysis and introduce autoregressive models such as ARMA and ARIMA for time series forecasting. Later, powerful deep learning methods are presented, to develop accurate forecasting models for complex time series, and under the availability of little domain knowledge. All the topics are illustrated with real-life problem scenarios and their solutions by best-practice implementations in Python.The book concludes with the Appendix, with a brief discussion of programming and solving data science problems using Python. »--},

	abstract = {Background: Digital phenotyping (also known as personal sensing, intelligent sensing, or body computing) involves the collection of biometric and personal data in situ from digital devices, such as smartphones, wearables, or social media, to measure behavior or other health indicators. The collected data are analyzed to generate moment-by-moment quantification of a person’s mental state and potentially predict future mental states. Digital phenotyping projects incorporate data from multiple sources, such as electronic health records, biometric scans, or genetic testing. As digital phenotyping tools can be used to study and predict behavior, they are of increasing interest for a range of consumer, government, and health care applications. In clinical care, digital phenotyping is expected to improve mental health diagnoses and treatment. At the same time, mental health applications of digital phenotyping present significant areas of ethical concern, particularly in terms of privacy and data protection, consent, bias, and accountability.
Objective: This study aims to develop consensus statements regarding key areas of ethical guidance for mental health applications of digital phenotyping in the United States.
Methods: We used a modified Delphi technique to identify the emerging ethical challenges posed by digital phenotyping for mental health applications and to formulate guidance for addressing these challenges. Experts in digital phenotyping, data science, mental health, law, and ethics participated as panelists in the study. The panel arrived at consensus recommendations through an iterative process involving interviews and surveys. The panelists focused primarily on clinical applications for digital phenotyping for mental health but also included recommendations regarding transparency and data protection to address potential areas of misuse of digital phenotyping data outside of the health care domain.
Results: The findings of this study showed strong agreement related to these ethical issues in the development of mental health applications of digital phenotyping: privacy, transparency, consent, accountability, and fairness. Consensus regarding the recommendation statements was strongest when the guidance was stated broadly enough to accommodate a range of potential applications. The privacy and data protection issues that the Delphi participants found particularly critical to address related to the perceived inadequacies of current regulations and frameworks for protecting sensitive personal information and the potential for sale and analysis of personal data outside of health systems.
Conclusions: The Delphi study found agreement on a number of ethical issues to prioritize in the development of digital phenotyping for mental health applications. The Delphi consensus statements identified general recommendations and principles regarding the ethical application of digital phenotyping to mental health. As digital phenotyping for mental health is implemented in clinical care, there remains a need for empirical research and consultation with relevant stakeholders to further understand and address relevant ethical issues.},

This promising new approach has been developed as an objective, passive assessment tool for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. Digital phenotyping is currently used with informed consent in research studies but is expected to expand to broader uses in healthcare and direct-to-consumer applications. Digital phenotyping could involve the collection of massive amounts of individual data and potential creation of new categories of health and risk assessment data. Because existing ethical and regulatory frameworks for the provision of mental healthcare do not clearly apply to digital phenotyping, it is critical to consider its possible ethical, legal, and social implications. This paper addresses four major areas where guidelines and best practices will be helpful: transparency, informed consent, privacy, and accountability. It will be important to consider these issues early in the development of this new approach so that its promise is not limited by harmful effects or unintended consequences.},

	abstract = {During the last years, an extraordinary effort has been made to identify biomarkers as potential tools for improving prevention, diagnosis, drug response and drug development in psychiatric disorders. Contrary to other diseases, mental illnesses are classified by diagnostic categories with a broad variety list of symptoms. Consequently, patients diagnosed from the same psychiatric illness present a great heterogeneity in their clinical presentation. This fact together with the incomplete knowledge of the neurochemical alterations underlying mental disorders, contribute to the limited efficacy of current pharmacological options. In this respect, the identification of biomarkers in psychiatry is becoming essential to facilitate diagnosis through the developing of markers that allow to stratify groups within the syndrome, which in turn may lead to more focused treatment options. In order to shed light on this issue, this review summarizes the concept and types of biomarkers including an operational definition for therapeutic development. Besides, the advances in this field were summarized and sorted into five categories, which include genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenetics. While promising results were achieved, there is a lack of biomarker investigations especially related to treatment response to psychiatric conditions. This review includes a final conclusion remarking the future challenges required to reach the goal of developing valid, reliable and broadly-usable biomarkers for psychiatric disorders and their treatment. The identification of factors predicting treatment response will reduce trial-and-error switches of medications facilitating the discovery of new effective treatments, being a crucial step towards the establishment of greater personalized medicine.},

These signals can be passively monitored using sensors in smartphones, wearable accelerometers, Holter monitors, and multimodal sensing approaches that fuse multiple data types. Connection of these devices to the internet has made large scale studies feasible and is enabling a revolution in neuropsychiatric monitoring. Currently, evaluation and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders relies on clinical visits, which are infrequent and out of the context of a patient’s home environment. Moreover, the demand for clinical care far exceeds the supply of providers. The growing prevalence of context-aware and physiologically relevant digital sensors in consumer technology could help address these challenges, enable objective indexing of patient severity, and inform rapid adjustment of treatment in real-time. Here we review recent studies utilizing such sensors in the context of neuropsychiatric illnesses including stress and depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.},

All of Us, a program of federally funded investigators are interested in recruiting participants from native groups, but given the fraught history of genetic studies involving Indigenous peoples - including examples such as the Havasupai v.

For instance, we recommend that model developers implement governance structures that include patients and other stakeholders starting in the earliest phases of development. In addition, developers should be allowed to use already collected patient data without explicit consent, provided that they comply with federal regulations regarding research on human subjects and the privacy of health information.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital phenotyping is the use of data from smartphones and wearables collected in situ for capturing a digital expression of human behaviors. Digital phenotyping techniques can be used to analyze both passively (e.g., sensor) and actively (e.g., survey) collected data. Machine learning offers a possible predictive bridge between digital phenotyping and future clinical state. This review examines passive digital phenotyping across the schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorders, with a focus on machine-learning studies.
METHODS: A systematic review of passive digital phenotyping literature was conducted using keywords related to severe mental illnesses, data-collection devices (e.g., smartphones, wearables, actigraphy devices), and streams of data collected. Searches of five databases initially yielded 3312 unique publications. Fifty-one studies were selected for inclusion, with 16 using machine-learning techniques.
RESULTS: All studies differed in features used, data pre-processing, analytical techniques, algorithms tested, and performance metrics reported. Across all studies, the data streams and other study factors reported also varied widely. Machine-learning studies focused on random forest, support vector, and neural net approaches, and almost exclusively on bipolar disorder.
DISCUSSION: Many machine-learning techniques have been applied to passively collected digital phenotyping data in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Larger studies, and with improved data quality, are needed, as is further research on the application of machine learning to passive digital phenotyping data in early diagnosis and treatment of psychosis. In order to achieve greater comparability of studies, common data elements are identified for inclusion in future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital phenotyping promises to unobtrusively obtaining a continuous and objective input of symptomatology from patients' daily lives. The prime example are bipolar disorders, as smartphone parameters directly reflect bipolar symptomatology. Empirical studies, however, have yielded inconsistent findings. We believe that three main shortcomings have to be addressed to fully leverage the potential of digital phenotyping: short assessment periods, rare outcome assessments, and an extreme fragmentation of parameters without an integrative analytical strategy.
METHODS: To demonstrate how to overcome these shortcomings, we conducted frequent (biweekly) dimensional and categorical expert ratings and daily self-ratings over an extensive assessment period (12 months) in 29 patients with bipolar disorder. Digital phenotypes were monitored continuously. As an integrative analytical strategy, we used structural equation modelling to build latent psychopathological outcomes (mania, depression) and latent digital phenotype predictors (sleep, activity, communicativeness).
OUTCOMES: Combining gold-standard categorical expert ratings with dimensional self and expert ratings resulted in two latent outcomes (mania and depression) with statistically meaningful factor loadings that dynamically varied over 299 days. Latent digital phenotypes of sleep and activity were associated with same-day latent manic psychopathology, suggesting that psychopathological alterations in bipolar disorders relate to domains (latent variables of sleep and activity) and not only to specific behaviors (such as the number of declined incoming calls). The identification of latent psychopathological outcomes that dimensionally vary on a daily basis will enable to empirically determine which combination of digital phenotypes at which days prior to an upcoming episode are viable as digital prodromal predictors.},

	url = {http://mhealth.jmir.org/2018/8/e165/},
	doi = {10.2196/mhealth.9691},
	abstract = {Background: Several studies have recently reported on the correlation between objective behavioral features collected via mobile and wearable devices and depressive mood symptoms in patients with affective disorders (unipolar and bipolar disorders). However, individual studies have reported on different and sometimes contradicting results, and no quantitative systematic review of the correlation between objective behavioral features and depressive mood symptoms has been published.
Objective: The objectives of this systematic review were to (1) provide an overview of the correlations between objective behavioral features and depressive mood symptoms reported in the literature and (2) investigate the strength and statistical significance of these correlations across studies. The answers to these questions could potentially help identify which objective features have shown most promising results across studies.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature, reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Web of Sciences, PsychINFO, PubMed, DBLP computer science bibliography, HTA, DARE, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched and supplemented by hand examination of reference lists. The search ended on April 27, 2017, and was limited to studies published between 2007 and 2017.
Results: A total of 46 studies were eligible for the review. These studies identified and investigated 85 unique objective behavioral features, covering 17 various sensor data inputs. These features were divided into 7 categories. Several features were found to have statistically significant and consistent correlation directionality with mood assessment (eg, the amount of home stay, sleep duration, and vigorous activity), while others showed directionality discrepancies across the studies (eg, amount of text messages [short message service] sent, time spent between locations, and frequency of mobile phone screen activity).
Conclusions: Several studies showed consistent and statistically significant correlations between objective behavioral features collected via mobile and wearable devices and depressive mood symptoms. Hence, continuous and everyday monitoring of behavioral aspects in affective disorders could be a promising supplementary objective measure for estimating depressive mood symptoms. However, the evidence is limited by methodological issues in individual studies and by a lack of standardization of (1) the collected objective features, (2) the mood assessment methodology, and (3) the statistical methods applied. Therefore, consistency in data collection and analysis in future studies is needed, making replication studies as well as meta-analyses possible.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in analyzing human behavioral data generated by new technologies. One type of digital footprint that is universal across the world, but that has received relatively little attention to date, is spending behavior. In this paper, using the transaction records of 1306 bank customers, we investigated the extent to which individual-level psychological characteristics can be inferred from bank transaction data. Speciﬁcally, we developed a more comprehensive feature space using: (1) overall spending behavior (i.e. total number and total amount of transaction), (2) temporal spending behavior (i.e. variability, persistence, and burstiness), (3) category-related spending behavior (i.e. diversity, persistence, and turnover), (4) customer category proﬁle, and (5) socio-demographic information. Using these features, we ﬁrst explore their association with individual psychological characteristics, we then analyze the performances of the diﬀerent feature families and ﬁnally, we try to understand to what extent psychological characteristics from spending records can be inferred. Our results show that inferring the psychological traits of an individual is a challenging task, even when using a comprehensive set of features that take temporal aspects of spending into account. We found that Materialism and Self-Control could be inferred with relatively high levels of accuracy, while the accuracy obtained for the Big Five traits was lower, with only Extraversion and Neuroticism reaching reasonable classiﬁcation performances.},

	abstract = {Clinical decision support system, which uses advanced data mining techniques to help clinician make proper decisions, has received considerable attention recently. The advantages of clinical decision support system include not only improving diagnosis accuracy but also reducing diagnosis time. Specifically, with large amounts of clinical data generated everyday, naïve Bayesian classification can be utilized to excavate valuable information to improve a clinical decision support system. Although the clinical decision support system is quite promising, the flourish of the system still faces many challenges including information security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a new privacy-preserving patient-centric clinical decision support system, which helps clinician complementary to diagnose the risk of patients' disease in a privacy-preserving way. In the proposed system, the past patients' historical data are stored in cloud and can be used to train the naïve Bayesian classifier without leaking any individual patient medical data, and then the trained classifier can be applied to compute the disease risk for new coming patients and also allow these patients to retrieve the top-k disease names according to their own preferences. Specifically, to protect the privacy of past patients' historical data, a new cryptographic tool called additive homomorphic proxy aggregation scheme is designed. Moreover, to leverage the leakage of naïve Bayesian classifier, we introduce a privacy-preserving top-k disease names retrieval protocol in our system. Detailed privacy analysis ensures that patient's information is private and will not be leaked out during the disease diagnosis phase. In addition, performance evaluation via extensive simulations also demonstrates that our system can efficiently calculate patient's disease risk with high accuracy in a privacy-preserving way.},

	abstract = {Psychiatric disorders are amongst the most prevalent and impairing conditions in childhood and adolescence. Unfortunately, it is well known that general practitioners (GPs) and other frontline health providers (i.e., child protection workers, public health nurses, and pediatricians) are not adequately trained to address these ubiquitous problems (Braddick et al. Child and Adolescent mental health in Europe: infrastructures, policy and programmes, European Communities, 2009; Levav et al. Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry 13:395–401, 2004). Advances in technology may offer a solution to this problem with clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that are designed to help professionals make sound clinical decisions in real time. This paper offers a systematic review of currently available CDSS for child and adolescent mental health disorders prepared according to the PRISMA-Protocols (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols). Applying strict eligibility criteria, the identified studies (n = 5048) were screened. Ten studies, describing eight original clinical decision support systems for child and adolescent psychiatric disorders, fulfilled inclusion criteria. Based on this systematic review, there appears to be a need for a new, readily available CDSS for child neuropsychiatric disorder which promotes evidence-based, best practices, while enabling consideration of national variation in practices by leveraging data-reuse to generate predictions regarding treatment outcome, addressing a broader cluster of clinical disorders, and targeting frontline practice environments.},

This article presents the results of a prospective randomized-controlled trial investigating the effects of a digital decision support and feedback system, which includes two components of patient-specific recommendations: (a) a clinical strategy recommendation and (b) adaptive recommendations for patients at risk for treatment failure. Method: Therapist–patient dyads ( N = 538) in a cognitive behavioral therapy outpatient clinic were randomized to either having access to a decision support system (intervention group; n = 335) or not (treatment as usual; n = 203). First, treatment strategy recommendations (problem-solving, motivation-oriented, or a mix of both strategies) for the first 10 sessions were evaluated. Second, the effect of psychometric feedback enhanced with clinical problem-solving tools on treatment outcome was investigated. Results: The prospective evaluation showed a differential effect size of about 0.3 when therapists followed the recommended treatment strategy in the first 10 sessions. Moreover, the linear mixed models revealed therapist symptom awareness and therapist attitude and confidence as significant predictors of an outcome as well as therapist-rated usefulness of feedback as a significant moderator of the feedback—outcome and the not on track—outcome associations. However, no main effects were found for feedback. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the importance of prospective studies and the high-quality implementation of digital decision support tools in clinical practice. Therapists seem to be able to learn from such systems and incorporate them into their clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes, but only when implementation is successful.

This randomized clinical implementation trial provides insight into the evaluation of a clinical decision support and feedback system including personalized pretherapy recommendations and enhanced psychometric feedback during treatment. As it is one of the first decision systems to have been implemented and evaluated prospectively in mental health, this study helps to improve such systems designed to support and change the way psychotherapy is conducted. The results underscore the importance of high-quality implementation of digital decision support tools in clinical practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Objectives
This study proposes methods for blending design components of clinical effectiveness and implementation research. Such blending can provide benefits over pursuing these lines of research independently; for example, more rapid translational gains, more effective implementation strategies, and more useful information for decision makers. This study proposes a “hybrid effectiveness-implementation” typology, describes a rationale for their use, outlines the design decisions that must be faced, and provides several real-world examples.

Results
An effectiveness-implementation hybrid design is one that takes a dual focus a priori in assessing clinical effectiveness and implementation. We propose 3 hybrid types: (1) testing effects of a clinical intervention on relevant outcomes while observing and gathering information on implementation; (2) dual testing of clinical and implementation interventions/strategies; and (3) testing of an implementation strategy while observing and gathering information on the clinical intervention’s impact on relevant outcomes.

Conclusions
The hybrid typology proposed herein must be considered a construct still in evolution. Although traditional clinical effectiveness and implementation trials are likely to remain the most common approach to moving a clinical intervention through from efficacy research to public health impact, judicious use of the proposed hybrid designs could speed the translation of research findings into routine practice.},

Participants also completed SRM entries using a smartphone app.Results We found that automated sensing can be used to infer the SRM score. Using location, distance traveled, conversation frequency, and non-stationary duration as inputs, our generalized model achieves root-mean-square-error of 1.40, a reasonable performance given the range of SRM score (0–7). Personalized models further improve performance with mean root-mean-square-error of 0.92 across users. Classifiers using sensor streams can predict stable (SRM score ≥3.5) and unstable (SRM score \&lt;3.5) states with high accuracy (precision: 0.85 and recall: 0.86).Conclusions Automatic smartphone sensing is a feasible approach for inferring rhythmicity, a key marker of wellbeing for individuals with BD.},

	abstract = {Implementing a digital mental health service in primary care requires integration into clinic workflow. However, without adequate attention to service design, including designing referral pathways to identify and engage patients, implementation will fail. This article reports results from our efforts designing referral pathways for a randomized clinical trial evaluating a digital service for depression and anxiety delivered through primary care clinics. We utilized three referral pathways: direct to consumer (e.g., digital and print media, registry emails), provider referral (i.e., electronic health record [EHR] order and provider recommendation), and other approaches (e.g., presentations, word of mouth). Over the 5-month enrollment, 313 individuals completed the screen and reported how they learned about the study. Penetration was 13\%, and direct to consumer techniques, most commonly email, had the highest yield. Providers only referred 16 patients through the EHR, half of whom initiated the screen. There were no differences in referral pathway based on participants' age, depression severity, or anxiety severity at screening. Ongoing discussions with providers revealed that the technologic implementation and workflow design may not have been optimal to fully affect the EHR-based referral process, which potentially limited patient access. Results highlight the importance of designing and evaluating referral pathways within service implementation, which is important for guiding the implementation of digital services into practice. Doing so can ensure that sustained implementation is not left to post-evaluation bridge-building. Future efforts should assess these and other referral pathways implemented in clinical practice outside of a research trial.},

	abstract = {U.S. health care systems are tasked with alleviating the burden of mental health, but are frequently underprepared and lack workforce and resource capacity to deliver services to all in need. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) can increase access to evidence-based mental health care. However, DMHIs commonly do not fit into the day-to-day activities of the people who engage with them, resulting in a research-to-practice gap for DMHI implementation. For health care settings, differences between digital and traditional mental health services make alignment and integration challenging. Specialized attention is needed to improve the implementation of DMHIs in health care settings so that these services yield high uptake, engagement, and sustainment. The purpose of this article is to enhance efforts to integrate DMHIs in health care settings by proposing implementation strategies, selected and operationalized based on the discrete strategies established in the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change project, that align to DMHI-specific barriers in these settings. Guidance is offered in how these strategies can be applied to DMHI implementation across four phases commonly distinguished in implementation science using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment Framework. Next steps to advance research in this area and improve the research-to-practice gap for implementing DMHIs are recommended. Applying implementation strategies to DMHI implementation will enable psychologists to systematically evaluate this process, which can yield an enhanced understanding of the factors that facilitate implementation success and improve the translation of DMHIs from controlled trials to real-world settings.

Seventeen patients with schizophrenia in active treatment at a state mental health clinic in Boston used the Beiwe app on their personal smartphone for up to 3 months. By testing for changes in mobility patterns and social behavior over time as measured through smartphone use, we were able to identify statistically significant anomalies in patient behavior in the days prior to relapse. We found that the rate of behavioral anomalies detected in the 2 weeks prior to relapse was 71\% higher than the rate of anomalies during other time periods. Our findings show how passive smartphone data, data collected in the background during regular phone use without active input from the subjects, can provide an unprecedented and detailed view into patient behavior outside the clinic.

	abstract = {Background
Demand for mental health services, especially for clinical high-risk and early psychosis, has increased, creating a need for new solutions to increase access to and quality of care. Smartphones and mobile technology are potential tools to support coordinated specialty care for early psychosis, given their potential to augment the six core roles of care: case management and team leadership, recovery-oriented psychotherapy, medication management, support for employment and education, coordination with primary care services, and family education and support. However, the services smartphones are actually offering specifically for coordinated specialty care and the level of evidence are unknown.

Objective
This study aimed to review the published literature on smartphone technology to enhance care for patients with prodromal and early course psychosis and schizophrenia and to analyze studies by type, aligned with coordinated specialty care domains.

Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted on August 16 and 17, 2019, using the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, and PsycINFO electronic databases. The eligible studies were reviewed and screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results
The search uncovered 388 unique results, of which 32 articles met the initial inclusion criteria; 21 eligible studies on 16 unique app platforms were identified. Feasibility studies showed a high user engagement and interest among patients, monitoring studies demonstrated a correlation between app assessments and clinical outcomes, and intervention studies indicated that these apps have the potential to advance care. Eighteen studies reported on app use for the case management roles of coordinated specialty care. No app studies focused on employment and education, coordination with primary care services, and family education and support.

Conclusions
Although the published literature on smartphone apps for prodromal and first-episode psychosis is small, it is growing exponentially and holds promise to augment both monitoring and interventions. Although the research results and protocols for app studies are not well aligned with all coordinated specialty care roles today, high rates of adoption and feasibility suggest the potential for future efforts. These results will be used to develop coordinated specialty care–specific app evaluation scales and toolkits.},

Participants were instructed to carry the device with them and to complete brief self-reports multiple times a week. Multimodal behavioral sensing (i.e., physical activity, geospatials activity, speech frequency, and duration) and device use data (i.e., call and text activity, app use) were captured automatically. Five individuals who experienced psychiatric hospitalization were selected and described for instructive purposes.ResultsParticipants had unique digital indicators of their psychotic relapse. For some, self-reports provided clear and potentially actionable description of symptom exacerbation prior to hospitalization. Others had behavioral sensing data trends (e.g., shifts in geolocation patterns, declines in physical activity) or device use patterns (e.g., increased nighttime app use, discontinuation of all smartphone use) that reflected the changes they experienced more effectively.ConclusionAdvancements in mobile technology are enabling collection of an abundance of information that until recently was largely inaccessible to clinical research and practice. However, remote monitoring and relapse detection is in its nascence. Development and evaluation of innovative data management, modeling, and signal-detection techniques that can identify changes within an individual over time (i.e., unique relapse signatures) will be essential if we are to capitalize on these data to improve treatment and prevention.

	abstract = {In mental health disorder, Bipolar Disorder (BD) is one of the most common mental illness. Using rating scales for assessment is one of the approaches for diagnosing and tracking BD patients. However, the requirement for manpower and time is heavy in the process of evaluation. In order to reduce the cost of social and medical resources, this study collects the user’s data by the App on smartphones, consisting of location data (GPS), self-report scales, daily mood, sleeping time and records of multi-media (text, speech, video) which are heterogeneous digital phenotyping data, to build a database. The features of each heterogeneous digital phenotyping data are extracted independently. Lasso Regression and ElasticNet Regression methods are employed to predict the score of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), as a reference for the evaluation of BD. As incomplete and missing data are very common in medical research, the ensemble method is adopted to combine the results from different models trained with different combinations of missing data. The collected heterogeneous digital phenotyping data from 84 BD patients were used for training and evaluation of the proposed approach based on five-fold cross validation method.

	abstract = {Background
Bias-prone psychiatric interviews remain the mainstay of bipolar disorder (BD) assessment. The development of digital phenotyping promises to improve BD management. We present a systematic review of the evidence about the use of portable digital devices for the identification of BD, BD types and BD mood states and for symptom assessment.
Methods
We searched Web of KnowledgeSM, Scopus ®, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library databases (until 5/1/2021) for articles evaluating the use of portable/wearable digital devices, such as smartphone apps, wearable sensors, audio and/or visual recordings, and multimodal tools. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020200086).
Results
We included 62 studies (2325 BD; 724 healthy controls, HC): 27 using smartphone apps, either for recording self-assessments (n = 10) or for passively gathering metadata (n = 7) or both (n = 10); 15 using wearable sensors for physiological parameters; 17 analysing audio and/or video recordings; 3 using multiple technologies. Two thirds of the included studies applied artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches. They achieved fair to excellent classification performances.
Limitations
The included studies had small sample sizes and marked heterogeneity. Evidence of overfitting emerged, limiting generalizability. The absence of clear guidelines about reporting classification performances, with no shared standard metrics, makes results hardly interpretable and comparable.
Conclusions
New technologies offer a noteworthy opportunity to BD digital phenotyping with objectivity and high granularity. AI-based models could deliver important support in clinical decision-making. Further research and cooperation between different stakeholders are needed for addressing methodological, ethical and socio-economic considerations.},

	abstract = {Aim Pennsylvania (PA) first-episode psychosis (FEP) program evaluation is a statewide initiative, supported by the PA Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (PA-OMHSAS) and administered by PA Early Intervention Center/Heads Up, which evaluates fidelity and outcomes of PA Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs. Programs participate in standard computerized measures of CSC outcomes using centralized informatics. The aims of the current report are to describe implementation of this core battery for program evaluation in PA and to present 6- and 12-month outcomes. Methods Participants (n = 697) from nine PA CSC programs completed the core battery at admission. The battery was re-administered at 6- and 12-month follow-up, and data were analysed for individuals (n = 230) who had completed 12-months of treatment. Domains assessed via clinician report and/or self-report included symptoms, role and social functioning, self-perceived recovery and service utilization. Results PA FEP CSC participants showed improvement over time in several domains, including decreased symptoms, higher role and social functioning, decreased hospitalizations, and improved self-perception of recovery, quality of life, and services satisfaction. Trends towards improvements were observed for participant happiness, hopelessness, and school-enrolment. Nearly all improvements were observed at 6-month follow-up, with earlier gains maintained at 12-months. Conclusions PA FEP CSC programs demonstrate the ability to assess and improve critical outcomes of coordinated specialty care in PA. Improved outcomes by 12 months in treatment provides evidence of an effective treatment model and supports the continuation of these programs in pursuit of our goal of reducing schizophrenia disease burden on individuals and society.},

Specifically, the article uses a mixed-method approach to look at the role of professional codes of ethics and explores the relationship between modelers’ experiences with, and attitudes toward, codes of ethics and their values. Statistical analysis of survey data reveals a relationship between modelers’ values and their attitudes and experiences related to codes of ethics. Thematic analysis of interviews with a subset of survey participants identifies two key themes: that modelers should be faithful to the reality and values of users and that codes of ethics should be built from the bottom up. One important implication of the research is that those who value universalism and benevolence may have a particular duty to act on their values and advocate for, and work to develop, a code of ethics.},

	abstract = {Background: Wearable devices are now widely available to collect continuous objective behavioral data from individuals and to measure sleep.
Objective: This study aims to introduce a pipeline to infer sleep onset, duration, and quality from raw accelerometer data and then quantify the relationships between derived sleep metrics and other variables of interest.
Methods: The pipeline released here for the deep phenotyping of sleep, as the DPSleep software package, uses a stepwise algorithm to detect missing data; within-individual, minute-based, spectral power percentiles of activity; and iterative, forward-and-backward–sliding windows to estimate the major Sleep Episode onset and offset. Software modules allow for manual quality control adjustment of the derived sleep features and correction for time zone changes. In this paper, we have illustrated the pipeline with data from participants studied for more than 200 days each.
Results: Actigraphy-based measures of sleep duration were associated with self-reported sleep quality ratings. Simultaneous measures of smartphone use and GPS location data support the validity of the sleep timing inferences and reveal how phone measures of sleep timing can differ from actigraphy data.
Conclusions: We discuss the use of DPSleep in relation to other available sleep estimation approaches and provide example use cases that include multi-dimensional, deep longitudinal phenotyping, extended measurement of dynamics associated with mental illness, and the possibility of combining wearable actigraphy and personal electronic device data (eg, smartphones and tablets) to measure individual differences across a wide range of behavioral variations in health and disease. A new open-source pipeline for deep phenotyping of sleep, DPSleep, analyzes raw accelerometer data from wearable devices and estimates sleep onset and offset while allowing for manual quality control adjustments.},

	title = {Why {Financial} {Institutions} {Need} to {Offer} {Supportive} {Banking} {Features}},
	url = {https://bit.ly/3EKcyGM},
	abstract = {Over forty-three million people experience a mental health issue  
annually. Mental health issues can make financial situations more  
complicated and financial stability more difficult to achieve. Furthermore, 
financial institutions are missing out on an opportunity to effectively  
serve the millions of Americans who live with a mental health disability.
Building on the research of Dr. Annie Harper—which itself is grounded in 
the perspectives and life experiences of individuals with mental health 
disabilities—this report proposes that financial institutions offer supportive 
banking features in order to make their products and services more  
accessible. In particular, there are three features that responsible financial 
institutions could easily implement: 1) customizable mobile banking  
notifications, 2) self-imposed spending limits on debit cards, and  
3) view-only account access. These features would both respond to the
expressed needs of individuals with mental health disabilities, as well
as comply with existing federal banking laws and regulations. In addition, 
these features will also appeal to a wide range of current and potential  
customers, such as young adults, individuals with disabilities, and  
older populations. 
Banking for All explains both why financial institutions should  
better serve individuals with mental health disabilities, and how these  
institutions might go about implementing these different features.  
Financial institutions have an opportunity to increase accessibility,  
and in so doing, help strengthen the financial health of individuals,  
families, and communities.},

	abstract = {The emergence of various forms of digital money and innovative digital financial services allows stores of value to be created, held, moved, measured, and exchanged in novel ways. Yet the success of these new forms of transactional media is largely dependent on the ways that they are understood as useful and credible as viable forms of exchange, and on how they support the ways that their users interact around them. This article therefore examines interactional work around the use of money in making financial transactions: we call this moneywork. We report on an empirical study of the patterns of behavior of users of a mixed media (digital and analog) currency that supports mobile device payments—the Bristol Pound—exploring the impacts of its users’ understanding of the systems that underlie these transactions, the technical constraints on their potential for action, their practices of use, and the social interactions that these activities lie within. We draw design implications to support these payment practices.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12889-015-1589-5},
	abstract = {Background: It has been suggested that improving people’s ability to deal with their finances, their financial capability, will directly improve their wellbeing and indirectly their health. To this end, financial capability initiatives have been funded by statutory and charitable health bodies, sometimes as part of a practice termed ‘social prescribing’. Discussion: This paper examines financial capability from the perspective of the Capability Approach to welfare and justice. It argues that the Approach shows current conceptions of financial capability to be flawed in that they focus on it as a personal quality in isolation from the socioeconomic environment. Using the Capability Approach as applied to disability the paper argues that financial capability is best viewed as a ‘conversion factor’ rather than a capability, that is, something necessary to convert resources, particularly money, into something of value to an individual, such as an adequate pension. Often, those judged as lacking financial capability are poor and this fact is at the heart of their inability to, say, plan a pension; by contrast, those who are not poor may find it relatively easy to do so and thus be deemed financially capable. Hence there are two distinct types of financial capability: i) in poverty and ii) not in poverty. To be able to plan a pension or make ends meet in poverty requires distinct and perhaps rare skills in an individual. However, some environmental or social changes may help individuals to improve their financial capability without calling on them to develop extraordinary abilities. Given the potential of such work to improve people’s health, making such changes can reasonably be described as Public Health work. The article concludes with a defence of this use of the Capability Approach against possible criticism. Summary: The Capability Approach enables analysis of financial capability that is theoretically important to and has practical implications for Public Health.},

Throughout this I mean to explore patient and clinician needs for managing BD through a data-driven intervention, as well as attitudes toward sharing personal data within social support networks to help support treatment, to develop a prototype for future evaluation.

	abstract = {Recent media revelations have demonstrated the extent of third-party tracking and monitoring online, much of it spurred by data aggregation, profiling, and selective targeting. How to protect privacy online is a frequent question in public discourse and has reignited the interest of government actors. In the United States, notice-and-consent remains the fallback approach in online privacy policies, despite its weaknesses. This essay presents an alternative approach, rooted in the theory of contextual integrity. Proposals to improve and fortify notice-and-consent, such as clearer privacy policies and fairer information practices, will not overcome a fundamental flaw in the model, namely, its assumption that individuals can understand all facts relevant to true choice at the moment of pair-wise contracting between individuals and data gatherers. Instead, we must articulate a backdrop of context-specific substantive norms that constrain what information websites can collect, with whom they can share it, and under what conditions it can be shared. In developing this approach, the paper warns that the current bias in conceiving of the Net as a predominantly commercial enterprise seriously limits the privacy agenda.},

	abstract = {Background The association between poor mental health and poverty is well known but its mechanism is not fully understood. This study tests the hypothesis that the association between low income and mental disorder is mediated by debt and its attendant financial hardship. Method The study is a cross-sectional nationally representative survey of private households in England, Scotland and Wales, which assessed 8580 participants aged 16–74 years living in general households. Psychosis, neurosis, alcohol abuse and drug abuse were identified by the Clinical Interview Schedule – Revised, the Schedule for Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and other measures. Detailed questions were asked about income, debt and financial hardship. Results Those with low income were more likely to have mental disorder [odds ratio (OR) 2.09, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.68–2.59] but this relationship was attenuated after adjustment for debt (OR 1.58, 95\% CI 1.25–1.97) and vanished when other sociodemographic variables were also controlled (OR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.77–1.48). Of those with mental disorder, 23\% were in debt (compared with 8\% of those without disorder), and 10\% had had a utility disconnected (compared with 3\%). The more debts people had, the more likely they were to have some form of mental disorder, even after adjustment for income and other sociodemographic variables. People with six or more separate debts had a six-fold increase in mental disorder after adjustment for income (OR 6.0, 95\% CI 3.5–10.3). Conclusions Both low income and debt are associated with mental illness, but the effect of income appears to be mediated largely by debt.},

The term open banking is used to designate the availability of banks' customer data through application programming interfaces (APIs). Financial third party access refers to the mechanisms that facilitate the engagement of others in the management of our personal finances. Engaging trusted others in personal finances may be especially valuable for individuals experiencing financial hardship or life circumstances that place their financial stability at risk. We deployed a new third party access tool enabled by the UK Open Banking APIs for 90 days with 14 people who self-identified as living with a mental health condition. The tool, which was developed by a financial technology startup founded by the second author, allowed participants to select a trusted "ally" who was notified when certain transactions took place in participants' bank accounts. During the deployment, the 14 participants and 8 of their "allies" took part in a diary study and pre- and post-deployment interviews. The experiences of our participants reveal the inadequacy and shortcomings of existing formal third party access mechanisms, and the moneywork involved in financial third party access. We argue that focusing on this moneywork can help us design flexible, proportionate and practice-sensitive services for financial third party access that move beyond discourses of protection and control in order to enable meaningful financial collaboration.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Impulsivity and risk-taking behaviours are reported in bipolar disorder (BD). We examined whether ﬁnancial management skills are related to impulsivity in patients with BD.
Methods: We assessed ﬁnancial management skills using the Executive Personal Finance Scale (EPFS), impulsivity using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and response inhibition using an emotional go/no-go task in bipolar individuals (N = 21) and healthy controls (HC; N = 23).
Results: Patients had fewer ﬁnancial management skills and higher levels of impulsivity than HC. In patients and controls, increased impulsivity was associated with poorer personal ﬁnancial management. Patients and HC performed equally on the emotional go/no-go task. Higher BIS scores were associated with faster reaction times in HC. In patients, however, higher BIS scores were associated with slower reaction times, possibly indicating compensatory cognitive strategies to counter increased impulsivity.
Conclusions: Patients with BD may have reduced abilities to manage personal ﬁnances, when compared against healthy participants. Difﬁculty with personal ﬁnance management may arise in part as a result of increased levels of impulsivity. Patients may learn to compensate for increased impulsivity by modulating response times in our experimental situations although whether such compensatory strategies generalize to real-world situations is unknown.},

	abstract = {Topic: Although money management skills are essential for independent functioning in the community, when viewed from the framework of psychosocial rehabilitation, there have been few systematic models for teaching money management skills to consumers with psychiatric disabilities based on a recovery orientation. Purpose: For those diagnosed with psychiatric disabilities, better money management has consistently been shown to be associated with superior quality of life, fewer hospitalizations, and greater self-efficacy. Consumers frequently indicate that learning how to budget and staying out of debt are among their top goals for recovery with mental illness. The current paper reviews the issues of money management and mental health among people with psychiatric disabilities and proposes a recovery-oriented approach to increasing money management skills to increase community functioning among consumers. Sources Used: Published literature, clinical cases, and financial literacy resources. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Improving money management can lead to a number of benefits by helping consumers with psychiatric disabilities: 1) gain more knowledge about disability benefits, 2) improve basic financial skills, and 3) reduce vulnerability to financial exploitation. Future work on incorporating this model into psychiatric rehabilitation programs would address skills consumers can use in living, working, and social environments in a way that enhances consumer choice and promotes recovery.

	abstract = {Objective: People with psychiatric disabilities experience substantial economic exclusion, which hinders their ability to achieve recovery and wellness. The purpose of this article is to describe a framework for a peer-supported economic empowerment intervention grounded in empirical literature and designed to enhance financial wellness. Method: The authors followed a 3-step process, including (a) an environmental scan of scientific literature, (b) a critical review of relevant conceptual frameworks, and (c) the design of an intervention logic framework based on (a) and (b), the programmatic experience of the authors, and input from peer providers. Results: We identified 6 peer provider functions to support individuals with psychiatric disabilities to overcome economic inclusion barriers, achieve financial wellness goals, and lessen the psychosocial impact of poverty and dependency. These include (a) engaging individuals in culturally meaningful conversations about life dreams and financial goals, (b) inspiring individuals to reframe self-defeating narratives by sharing personal stories, (c) facilitating a financial wellness action plan, (d) coaching to develop essential financial skills, (e) supporting navigation and utilization of financial and asset-building services, and (f) fostering mutual emotional and social support to achieve financial wellness goals. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Financial wellness requires capabilities that depend on gaining access to financial and asset-building supports, and not merely developing financial skills. The proposed framework outlines new roles and competencies for peer providers to help individuals build essential financial capabilities, and address social determinants of mental health and disability. Research is currently underway to pilot-test and refine peer-supported economic empowerment strategies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

Aims: (i) Identify characteristics of persons with PD, adult family members, and interactions with each other significantly associated with family money management (FMM). (ii) Identify significant differences in aforementioned characteristics between official versus unofficial FMM. Methods: Five hundred and seventy-three adults residing in USA with an adult relative with PD completed a survey. Results: Among persons with PD, FMM was positively associated with lower income, diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective or bipolar disorder, psychiatric hospitalization, and arrest history. FMM was negatively associated with family members having a mental health diagnosis. FMM was positively associated with interaction characteristics of co-residence, financial assistance, caregiving, and use of limit-setting practices. Compared to official FMM, when unofficial FMM was present, persons with PD were less likely to have been psychiatrically hospitalized or to have regularly attended mental health treatment. When unofficial FMM was present, adult family members were less likely to be a parent of the person with PD. Conclusions: Practitioners should assess the level of burden experienced by family money managers and assess and address with family money managers the use of limit-setting practices.},

Three primary socialization agents were identified. The family as trusted primary advisor continues well into adulthood, even where family financial capability may be low. Beyond this, emerging adults only reluctantly engage with their bank, rely on just-in-time experiential learning or self-socialize via diving, often with false confidence, into the internet. Although there are many quantitative studies on financial socialization, this paper fills a gap by taking a deeply qualitative approach showing, for the first time, empirically highlighting the limited number of financial socialization agents through the voices of emerging adults. The findings contradict previous socialization research that suggests parental socialization reduces into adulthood.},

The study found that 59 percent (n = 161) reported experiencing ﬁnancial hardship in the past 12 months. Patients with ﬁnancial hardship were more likely to be female, to experience self-stigma, to experience medical care delays, and to use emergency services. Patients who experienced ﬁnancial hardship typically had more severe psychiatric symptoms, including depressive symptoms, emotional lability, and interpersonal problems. Financial hardship persisted in nearly half of those with hardship interviewed a year later. The ﬁndings highlight the role of multiple social and economic challenges that the SMI patients face in recovery from serious mental illness and the importance of awareness of such challenges by providers treating this population. Though mental health treatment may help alleviate the psychiatric symptoms it alone is not suﬃcient in addressing persistent hardship. These ﬁndings highlight the need for multidisciplinary interventions in order to better serve this vulnerable population.},

Families develop ‘systems’ or methods through which they coordinate and manage their everyday financial activities. Through an analysis of our fieldwork data collected from fifteen families, we provide several examples of such systems, highlighting their qualities and illustrating how such systems come to support the handling of financial activities in the home. Our results show that these systems are developed with a careful consideration of familial values, relationships and routines; and incorporate the use of physical and digital tools. Consequently, we suggest that design should consider the use and non-use of technology when supporting household financial management, taking into account the richness of families’ existing organically formed practices surrounding financial systems. Finally, our findings point to the fact that financial management in the domestic setting is socially organized and is closely connected to supporting everyday household activities.},

When explaining this association, emphasis has often been placed on financial capability, i.e. the capacity of those living with poor mental health to manage their money. This paper challenges such capability-based explanations by reporting on a diary study and interviews with 14 people who self-identify as living with a mental health condition. We focused on their experiences of financial technology use, and explored the role technology played in their strategies to minimise the impact of mental health on their economic circumstances. Rather than lacking capability, participants’ practices revealed shortcomings of existing financial technologies and how they sought to work around these. We conclude by providing a set of design directions for technologies that engage those living with poor mental health not as vulnerable targets for financial inclusion, but as full financial citizens.},

	abstract = {Background
The current societal costs of bipolar I disorder (BDI) have not been comprehensively characterized in the United States, as previous studies are based on data from two decades ago.
Methods
The costs of BDI were estimated for 2015 and comprised direct healthcare costs, non-healthcare costs, and indirect costs, calculated based on a BDI prevalence of 1\%. The excess costs of BDI were estimated as the difference between the costs incurred by individuals with BDI and those incurred by individuals without BD or individuals from the general population. Direct healthcare costs were assessed using three large US claims databases for insured individuals and the literature for uninsured individuals. Direct non-healthcare and indirect costs were based on the literature and governmental publications.
Results
The total costs of BDI were estimated at \$202.1 billion in 2015, corresponding to an average of \$81,559 per individual, while the excess costs of BDI were estimated at \$119.8 billion, corresponding to an average of \$48,333 per individual. The largest contributors to excess costs were caregiving (36\%), direct healthcare costs (21\%), and unemployment (20\%). In sensitivity analyses, excess costs ranged from \$101.2 to \$124.3 billion.
Limitations
Direct healthcare costs were calculated based on a BDI diagnosis, thus excluding undiagnosed patients. Direct non-healthcare and indirect costs were based on combined estimates from the literature.
Conclusions
Besides direct healthcare costs, BDI was associated with substantial direct non-healthcare and indirect costs. More effective treatments and practices are needed to optimize therapeutic strategies and contain direct and indirect costs.},

Methods: Currently available assessment tools suitable for use with patients with bipolar disorder were identified through a MEDLINE search using the following key terms: bipolar, screening, diagnosis, monitoring. Only peer-reviewed papers published in English were considered for further review. Results: A review of the current literature revealed a small number of published and appropriately validated clinical tools suitable for the assessment of bipolar disorder in terms of screening, diagnosis, and long-term monitoring. Conclusions: While there are a large number of formal rating scales for the assessment of various clinical aspects of bipolar spectrum disorders, there are currently only a limited number of assessment tools well suited for use in routine clinical practice. Widespread use of brief, clinically validated, and easy to use screening tools could facilitate the early identification of patients with bipolar spectrum disorders. A less structured diagnostic approach should facilitate diagnosis of the more subtle forms of the disease, particularly bipolar II disorder. Long-term monitoring tools should strengthen the therapeutic alliance between the patient and clinician and improve long-term quality of care and assessment of outcomes.},

Panel surveys, nationally representative epidemiological surveys and psychological autopsy studies have examined the relationship, as have studies on specific populations such as university students, debt management clients and older adults. Most studies examined relationships with mental health and depression in particular. Studies of physical health have also shown a relationship with self-rated health and outcomes such as obesity. There is also a strong relationship with suicide completion, and relationships with drug and alcohol abuse. The majority of studies found that more severe debt is related to worse health; however causality is hard to establish. A meta-analysis of pooled odds ratios showed a significant relationship between debt and mental disorder (OR=3.24), depression (OR=2.77), suicide completion (OR=7.9), suicide completion or attempt (OR=5.76), problem drinking (OR=2.68), drug dependence (OR=8.57), neurotic disorder (OR=3.21) and psychotic disorders (OR=4.03). There was no significant relationship with smoking (OR=1.35, p{\textgreater}.05). Future longitudinal research is needed to determine causality and establish potential mechanisms and mediators of the relationship.},

	abstract = {Background: Insight concerning having a mental illness has been found to influence outcome and effectiveness of treatment. It has been studied mainly in the area of schizophrenia with few studies addressing other disorders. This study evaluates insight in individuals with bipolar disorder using the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder (SUMD), a comprehensive interview for evaluation of awareness of illness and attribution of symptoms. The hypothesis was that in bipolar disorder level of awareness may be associated with numerous factors including neurocognitive function, structural changes in the frontal lobes and hippocampus evaluated by MRI, neurocognitive status, severity of mania and other psychiatric symptoms and comorbid alcoholism.
Method: In order to evaluate this hypothesis 33 individuals with DSM-IV diagnosed bipolar disorder, some with and some without comorbid alcoholism, were administered the SUMD and a number of other procedures including a quantitative MRI measuring volume of the frontal lobes and hippocampus, a brief battery of neurocognitive tests, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale. The data were analyzed by comparing participants with and without alcoholism on these procedures using t tests and by linear multiple regression, with SUMD ratings of awareness and attribution as the dependent variables and variable sets from the other procedures administered as multivariate independent variables.
Results: The median score obtained from the SUMD for current awareness was in a range between full awareness and uncertainty concerning presence of a mental disorder. For attribution, the median score indicated that attribution was usually made to the illness itself. None of the differences between participants with and without comorbid alcoholism were significant for the SUMD awareness and attribution scores, neurocognitive or MRI variables. The multiple regression analyses only showed a significant degree of association between the SUMD awareness score and the Young Mania Rating Scale (r2 = .632, p b .05). A stepwise analysis indicated that items assessing degree of insight, irritability, and sleep disturbance met criteria for entry into the regression equation. None of the regression analyses for the SUMD attribution item were significant.
Conclusions: Apparently unlike the case for schizophrenia, most of the participants, all of whom had bipolar disorder, were aware of their symptoms and correctly related them to a mental disorder. Hypotheses concerning the relationships between degree of unawareness and possible contributors to its development including comorbid alcoholism, cognitive dysfunction and structural reduction of gray matter in the frontal region and hippocampus, were not associated with degree of unawareness but symptoms of mania were significantly associated. The apparent reason for this result is that the sample obtained a SUMD modal awareness score of 1 or 2, reflecting the area between full awareness and uncertainty about having a mental disorder. None of the participants were rated as having a 5 response reflecting the belief that s/he does not have a mental disorder.},

	abstract = {Background: Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) has been designed for assessment of selfreflection on patients' anomalous experiences and interpretations of own beliefs. The scale has been developed and validated for patients with schizophrenia. We wanted to study the utility of the scale for patients with bipolar disorder. The relationship between the BCIS as a measure of cognitive insight and established methods for assessment of insight of illness was explored in both diagnostic groups.
Methods: The BCIS self-report inventory was administered to patients with schizophrenia (n = 143), bipolar disorder (n = 92) and controls (n = 64). The 15 items of the inventory form two subscales, self-reflectiveness and self-certainty.
Results: The internal consistency of the subscales was good for the patient groups and the controls. The mean subscale scores were not significantly different for the three groups. Four items in subscale self-reflectiveness referring to psychotic experiences gave, however, different results in the control subjects. Self-certainty and scores on insight item PANSS correlated significantly in the schizophrenia, but not in the bipolar group.
Conclusion: BCIS with its two subscales seems applicable for patients with bipolar disorder as well as for patients with schizophrenia. The self-report inventory can also be applied to control subjects if the items referring to psychotic experiences are omitted. In schizophrenia high scores on self-certainty is possibly associated with poor insight of illness. For the bipolar group the subscales are largely independent of traditional insight measures.},

Issues of financial capacity emerge frequently regarding clients with serious mental illness (SMI), and their resolution has practical and ethical significance for clients, their families, and mental health professionals. These issues include whether a client has sufficient financial skills and judgment to live independently, whether a client requires a representative payee, and what goals for community reintegration should be established with a client. Similar to informed consent, issues of financial capacity raise ethical challenges for clinicians, caseworkers, and agencies. The present article addresses clinical and research ethics questions related to financial capacity in clients with schizophrenia and SMI. Clinical questions concern evaluation of financial capacity in clients with SMI, whether to seek assignment of a mandatory representative payee, whether to leverage treatment compliance through a representative payee arrangement, and whether a mental health professional should also serve as a client's representative payee. The research ethics question addresses implications of providing financial compensation for research participation to individuals with SMI and limited financial capacity and means. The ultimate goal of this article is to focus clinical and ethical attention on a neglected decisional capacity in SMI that is of fundamental importance for clients, families, clinicians, and researchers.},

Several structured assessments of financial capacity have been developed, but have not been compared regarding their focus, validity, or reliability. Therefore, we conducted a review of financial capacity measures to examine these factors.We searched electronic databases, reference lists in identified articles, conference proceedings and other grey literature for measures of financial capacity. We then extracted data on the length and domains of each measure, the population for which they were intended, and their validity and reliability.We identified 10 structured measures of financial capacity. Most measures could be completed in 25–30 min, and were designed to be administered to older adults with some level of cognitive impairment. Reliability and validity were high for most.Measurement of financial capacity is complex and multidimensional. When selecting a measure of financial capacity, consideration should be made of the population of focus and the domains of capacity to be assessed. More work is needed on the cultural sensitivity of financial capacity measures, their acceptability, and their use in clinical work. Better understanding of when, and to whom, to administer different financial capacity measures could enhance the ability to accurately detect those suffering from impaired financial capacity, and prevent related negative outcomes like financial exploitation.},

However, no research has looked at the relationship between financial difficulties and psychological factors in bipolar disorder. Aims: This study aims to look at the relationship between financial difficulties and psychological factors in bipolar disorder.
Method: Fifty-four participants with diagnosis of bipolar disorder in an adult secondary care NHS mental health service completed the questionnaire pack which included measures examining financial variables including difficulty paying bills and perceived financial wellbeing. Questionnaires measured self-esteem, impulsivity, mindfulness and dysfunctional attitudes.
Results: Financial difficulties cross-sectionally were related to a number of psychological variables such as mindfulness and impulsivity. Over time, the strongest effects were for compulsive spending which was increased over time by higher dependency and achievement cognitions, lower mindfulness and lower self-esteem. Poor perceived financial wellness lower self-esteem over time. A psychological model incorporating these and related findings is presented.
Conclusion: Psychological factors appear to be related to financial difficulties in bipolar disorder. Future research is needed to confirm the model presented here and develop interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Risk-taking behaviours during hypomanic states are recognised, however the high-risk nature of some behaviours—including the potential for harm to both the individual and others—has not been detailed in the research literature. The current study examines risk-taking behaviours and their consequences (including their potential for impairment) in those with a bipolar II condition.
Method: Participants were recruited from the Sydney-based Black Dog Institute Depression Clinic. Diagnostic assignment of bipolar II disorder was based on clinician judgement and formal DSM-IV criteria. Participants completed a series of detailed questions assessing previous risk-taking behaviours during hypomanic states.
Results: The sample comprised a total of 93 participants. Risk-taking behaviours during hypomania included spending signiﬁcant amounts of money, excessive alcohol or drug use, dangerous driving and endangering sexual activities. Key consequences included interpersonal conﬂict, substantial ﬁnancial burden and feelings of guilt, shame and remorse. Despite recognition of the risks and consequences associated with hypomanic behaviours, less than one-ﬁfth of participants agreed that hypomania should be treated because of the associated risks. Limitations: Study limitations included a cross-sectional design, reliance on self-report information, lack of controlling for current mood state, and comprised a tertiary referral sample that may be weighted to more severe cases. Findings may therefore not be generalisable and require replication.
Conclusions: Risk-taking behaviours during hypomania are common, and often linked with serious consequences. Whilst hypomania is often enjoyed and romanticised by patients—leading to ambivalence around treatment of such states—careful consideration of the impact of risk-taking behaviour is necessary, while the study raises the question as to what is ‘impairment’ in hypomania. Findings should advance clinical management by identifying those high-risk behaviours that would beneﬁt from pre-emptive weighting in developing individual’s wellbeing plans for managing the condition.},

We focus on the case of personal data related to the self-tracking of bipolar disorder (BD) in order to explore the ways in which disclosure activities intersect with other privacy experiences. While research in HCI often discusses privacy as a disclosure activity, this does not reﬂect the ways in which privacy can be passively experienced. In this paper we broaden conceptions of privacy by deﬁning transparency experiences and contributing factors in contrast to disclosure activities and preferences. Next, we ground this theoretical move in empirical analysis of personal narratives shared by people managing BD. We discuss the resulting emergent model of transparency in terms of implications for the design of socially-enabled PI systems.

	abstract = {Personal informatics systems for supporting health largely grew out of a "self"-centric orientation: self-tracking, self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-experimentation, self-improvement. Health management, however, even when self-driven, is inherently social and depends on a person's direct relationships and broader sociocultural contexts, as an emerging line of research is coming to recognize, study, and support. This is particularly true in the case of mental health. In this paper, we engage with individuals managing the serious mental illness bipolar disorder and members of their support circles to (a) identify key social relations and the roles they play in condition management, (b) characterize patients' complex interactions with these relations (e.g., positive or negative, direct or peripheral, steady or unstable), and (c) understand how personal informatics mediates these recovery relations. Based on these insights, we offer a model of this social ecology, along with design implications for personal informatics systems that are sensitive to these interpersonal contexts.},

Peer support has been shown to address gaps in care, and could scale to wider audiences through technology. But technology design for mental health peer support lags far behind tools for individuals and clinicians. To identify opportunities for design, we interviewed 18 people with a diverse range of mental illnesses about their use of technology for peer support, and invited them to design technologies that could improve their experience of peer support. We found that technology could enhance peer support for mental health by: (1) matching peers on similarities beyond diagnosis; (2) enhancing accessibility; and (3) proactively mitigating risk through training and intervention. We discuss these findings in the context of the broad peer support literature, and present design opportunities for making mental health peer support tools empowering, accessible, and safe.},

prevalence for type 1 bipolar disorder is approximately 1\%, but inclusion
of more broadly defined conditions increases this rate to 2\% to 5\%. Bipolar disorder can begin in childhood or adolescence, continues throughout life, and is extraordinarily
costly—financially as well as clinically and socially. The
course of bipolar disorder is episodic but highly variable, with potential
for high levels of severity and recurrence intensity, disproportionately high
depressive morbidity, and comorbidity with substance abuse and anxiety disorders. Bipolar depression can be present during 20\% to 30\%
of patients' time, even during prophylactic treatment, and
is closely associated with disability and mortality. Bipolar
disorder proves fatal in a high proportion of patients from complications
of risk-taking behavior, comorbid stress-sensitive medical illnesses, and
especially suicide. These
characteristics mark bipolar disorder as a major unsolved public health challenge.},

Social recovery and external money management are important approaches in contemporary mental health care, but little research has been done on the relationship between the two or on application of recovery principles to money management for people at risk of being assigned a representative payee or conservator.

Methods
Twenty-five transcripts out of forty-nine total qualitative interviews with persons receiving SSI or SSDI who were at risk of being assigned a money manager were analyzed to assess the presence of recognized recovery themes.

Results
The recovery principles of self-direction and responsibility were strong themes in participant comments related to money management.

Conclusions and Implications for Practice
Money management interventions should incorporate peoples’ recovery-related motivations to acquire financial management skills as a means to direct and assume responsibility for one’s finances. Staff involved in money management should receive training to support client’s recovery-related goals.},

As such, a social frame of reference is helpful in design. Using a qualitative approach, the authors studied the ways that 13 Australian households living on a low income manage, organize, and interact in their everyday financial activities and what this means for designers of technology that might assist them with this. The article highlights the highly social nature of many practices concerned with managing and saving money. Implications are provided for how these practices may be supported through fostering social connections and how informal and sharing economies may be leveraged to provide value to those experiencing financial hardship. An argument is made that classifying an otherwise heterogeneous population based on income alone is reductive. In response, the authors propose a rationale for amending the “low income” demographic classifier, incorporating a broader measure they tentatively term Social–financial Connectedness, which captures the importance of social connections in overall financial well-being and identifies people’s capacity to live well and share, irrespective of their financial circumstances.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to assess the global, regional, and national burden of bipolar disorder (BPD) from 1990 to 2017, by gender, age, and social-demographic index (SDI) from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. We collected detailed information from GBD on the numbers of incidence cases and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) during 1990–2017. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to assess ASIR and ASDR trends. GBD data estimated that BPD incidences increased by 47.74\%, from 3.06 million in 1990 to 4.53 million in 2017, and the DALYs increased by 54.4\%, from 6.02 million in 1990 to 9.29 million in 2017. Over the 28-year period between 1990 and 2017, the ASIR and ASDR increased only slightly (EAPC = 0.14 and 0.05 for ASIR and ASDR, respectively). Subjects aged 10–19 years contributed the most to the total number of incidence cases, while those aged 20–44 years contributed the most to the number of DALYs. The ASIR and ASDR were highest in tropical Latin America and lowest in East Asia. Areas in the lowest sociodemographic index (SDI) quintile showed the highest ASIR (about 64/100,000), and those in the highest SDI quintile showed the highest ASDR (about 140/100,000). In conclusion, while the ASIR and ASDR due to BPD have been stable, the absolute incidence and DALYs remain high, which represents an increasing burden on health-care systems.},

	abstract = {Objective A diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) is often preceded by an initial diagnosis of depression, creating a delay in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of BD. Although previous research has focused on predictors of a diagnosis change from depression to BD, the research on this delay in diagnosis is sparse. Therefore, the present study examined the time taken to make a BD diagnosis following an initial diagnosis of major depressive disorder in order to further understand the patient characteristics and psychological factors that may explain this delay. Method A total of 382 patients underwent a clinical evaluation by a psychiatrist and completed a series of questionnaires. Results Ninety patients were initially diagnosed with depression with a later diagnosis of BD, with a mean delay in diagnostic conversion of 8.74 years. These patients who were later diagnosed with BD were, on average, diagnosed with depression at a younger age, experienced more manic symptoms, and had a more open personality style and better coping skills. Cox regressions showed that depressed patients with diagnoses that eventually converted to BD had been diagnosed with depression earlier and that this was related to a longer delay to conversion and greater likelihood of dysfunctional attitudes. Conclusion The findings from the present study suggested that an earlier diagnosis of depression is related to experiencing a longer delay in conversion to BD. The clinical implications of this are briefly discussed, with a view to reducing the seemingly inevitable delay in the diagnosis of BD.},

Mobile digital health (mHealth) interventions are increasingly being developed and evaluated, and have the potential to support recovery.

Thirty-eight studies comprised of 2262 participants met the inclusion criteria. Smartphones were the most popular mHealth device; personal digital assistants, wearables and tablets were also used. mHealth was widely found to be acceptable and feasible, with preliminary findings suggesting it can support functional recovery by augmenting an intervention, simplifying the assessment, increasing moni­ toring frequency and/or providing more detailed information. Considerations for overcoming barriers to implementation, recommendations for future research to establish effectiveness, personalisation and specifica­ tion of mHealth devices and methodologies are discussed. The value of mHealth for remote delivery of recovery based interventions is also considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Web-based resources can support people with bipolar disorder (BD) to improve their knowledge and self-management. However, publicly available resources are heterogeneous in terms of their quality and ease of use. Characterizing digital health literacy (the skillset that enable people to navigate and make use of health information in a web-based context) in BD will support the development of educational resources.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop understanding of digital health literacy and its predictors in people with BD.
METHODS: A web-based survey was used to explore self-reported digital health literacy (as measured by the e-Health Literacy Scale [eHEALS]) in people with BD. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate potential predictors, including demographic/clinical characteristics and technology use.
RESULTS: A total of 919 respondents (77.9\% female; mean age 36.9 years) completed the survey. Older age (β=0.09; P=.01), postgraduate education (β=0.11; P=.01), and current use of self-management apps related to BD (β=0.13; P{\textless}.001) were associated with higher eHEALS ratings.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of self-reported digital health literacy were comparable or higher than other studies in the general population and specific physical/mental health conditions. However, individuals with BD who are younger, have completed less education, or are less familiar with mental health apps may require extra support to safely and productively navigate web-based health resources. Relevant educational initiatives are discussed. Future studies should evaluate skill development interventions for less digitally literate groups.},

To support the development of app-based interventions, we explored use of and at­ titudes towards apps amongst people with BD, specifically concerns about privacy and preferences for various app features.
Methods: An international web-based survey was used to investigate concerns about privacy and the perceived importance of various app features among people with BD. Quantitative findings were summarised using descriptive statistics. Qualitative content analysis was used to investigate free-text responses.
Results: A total of 919 people completed the survey; 97.5\% reported using smartphone apps in general. Concerns regarding data security were prevalent. Commonly prioritised mHealth features included content quality/ac­ curacy, ease and flexibility of use, cost, and data security. The ability to share data with others, rewards for use, inter-app connectivity, and peer support were endorsed as important by fewer than half of respondents. Qual­ itative findings suggested that sustained app use could be supported by novel and positive content, custom­ isation, meaningful use of data, interactivity, and perceived real-world benefits.
Conclusions: The findings of the present study offer important design considerations for the development and evaluation of future app-based interventions for BD. Importantly, some features that have previously been suggested as clinically beneficial or likely to support engagement were perceived ambivalently, emphasising the need for in-depth consultation with potential end users during app development.},

In this study, we focus on descriptive results and qualitative analyses.Results Individuals reported primarily self-monitoring items related to their bipolar disorder (mood, sleep, finances, exercise, and social interactions), with an increasing trend towards the use of digital tracking methods observed. Most participants reported having positive experiences with technology-based tracking because it enables self-reflection and agency regarding health management and also enhances lines of communication with treatment teams. Reported challenges stem from poor usability or difficulty interpreting self-tracked data.Discussion Two major implications for technology-based self-monitoring emerged from our results. First, technologies can be designed to be more condition-oriented, intuitive, and proactive. Second, more automated forms of digital symptom tracking and intervention are desired, and our results suggest the feasibility of detecting and predicting emotional states from patterns of technology usage. However, we also uncovered tension points, namely that technology designed to support mental health can also be a disruptor.Conclusion This study provides increased understanding of self-monitoring practices, attitudes, and needs of individuals with bipolar disorder. This knowledge bears implications for clinical researchers and practitioners seeking insight into how individuals independently self-manage their condition as well as for researchers designing monitoring technologies to support mental health management.},

User privacy expectations for these new forms of data collection remain unclear. A particularly difficult challenge is meeting expectations for contextual integrity, as user privacy expectations vary depending upon data type collected and context of use. This article illustrates how fine-grained, contextual privacy expectations can be measured. It presents findings from a factorial vignette survey that measured the impact of diverse real-world contexts (e.g., medical, navigation, music), data types, and data uses on user privacy expectations. Results demonstrate that individuals’ general privacy preferences are of limited significance for predicting their privacy judgments in specific scenarios. Instead, the results present a nuanced portrait of the relative importance of particular contextual factors and information uses, and demonstrate how those contextual factors can be found and measured. The results also suggest that current common activities of mobile application companies, such as harvesting and reusing location data, images, and contact lists, do not meet users’ privacy expectations. Understanding how user privacy expectations vary according to context, data types, and data uses highlights areas requiring stricter privacy protections by governments and industry.},

CMs also coordinate patient-related issues internally with healthcare practitioners and externally with community organizations and insurance providers.

Workflow observations were conducted to supplement the interview data. We describe the role of CMs and identify challenges that they face in supporting patient mental health. A key challenge is a high degree of role ambiguity in this professional role.

	abstract = {Background
Smartphone apps have potential for delivering interventions and supporting self-management in bipolar disorder (BD), however clinical trials of mental health apps have high dropout rates and low sustained use in real-world contexts. To support the development of app-based interventions, we explored use of and attitudes towards apps amongst people with BD, specifically concerns about privacy and preferences for various app features.
Methods
An international web-based survey was used to investigate concerns about privacy and the perceived importance of various app features among people with BD. Quantitative findings were summarised using descriptive statistics. Qualitative content analysis was used to investigate free-text responses.
Results
A total of 919 people completed the survey; 97.5\% reported using smartphone apps in general. Concerns regarding data security were prevalent. Commonly prioritised mHealth features included content quality/accuracy, ease and flexibility of use, cost, and data security. The ability to share data with others, rewards for use, inter-app connectivity, and peer support were endorsed as important by fewer than half of respondents. Qualitative findings suggested that sustained app use could be supported by novel and positive content, customisation, meaningful use of data, interactivity, and perceived real-world benefits.
Conclusions
The findings of the present study offer important design considerations for the development and evaluation of future app-based interventions for BD. Importantly, some features that have previously been suggested as clinically beneficial or likely to support engagement were perceived ambivalently, emphasising the need for in-depth consultation with potential end users during app development.},

Worldwide about 1.7 billion people remain with no access to banking facilities as a form of financial exclusion which represents 31\% of the world’s general population. In contrast, in Western countries like Germany, 99\% of the general population use bank accounts.MethodsWe conducted an exploratory cross-sectional survey on bank account ownership and bank account access among psychiatric in-patients in a psychiatric hospital in Berlin. Out of 540 participants who were reached for an interview, 486 shared information about bank account ownership and 469 on access.ResultsOut of 486 participants 49 (10.1\%) did not own a bank account. Among the remaining 420 participants owning a bank account, 36 (8.3\%) did not have direct access to their bank account, but only, e.g., their legal guardian. Regression results found psychosis, intellectual disabilities, a longer treatment duration, as well as being of male gender and a more instable housing status to be significantly associated with a missing bank account or a missing access to one’s bank account.ConclusionsThe lack of bank account ownership and access among this population of psychiatric patients is concerning. The interrelationship between factors of financial exclusion and mental health should be further explored in longitudinal studies. More attention is needed to support people with severe mental illness to be able to access resources associated with financial inclusion.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05448},
	abstract = {The relationship between mental health and financial difficulties is complex. Those living with mental illnesses are at increased risk of financial hardships and debt-related stress. This can be further complicated by a range of problematic financial behaviors related to specific mental health symptoms, such as impulsive purchasing or missing deadlines. While previous studies have resulted in valuable insights on how mental health symptoms can manifest in specific financial behaviors, they might not lead to the complete picture given their reliance on self-reported perceptions of individual’s own behaviors. In other words, self-reported data can suffer from incomplete recall and other biases, particularly during symptomatic periods. Being able to access objective personal financial data can help to address this issue. Recent increased digitization of banking services have made fine grained personal financial data more accessible than ever before. By leveraging this objective financial data, we can more easily investigate this relationship — the ebb and flow of finances and mental health.
In this paper, we present novel research methods for collecting and analyzing personal financial data alongside mental health factors, illustrated through a N=1 case study using data from one individual with bipolar disorder. While we have not found statistically significant trends nor our findings are generalizable beyond this case, our approach provides an insight into the challenges of accessing objective financial data. We outline what data is currently available, what can be done with it, and what factors to consider when working with financial data. More specifically, using these methods researchers might be able to identify symptomatic traces of mental ill health in personal financial data such as identifying early warning signs and thereby enable preemptive care for individuals with serious mental illnesses. Based on this work, we have also explored future directions for developing interventions to support financial wellbeing. Furthermore, we have described the technical, ethical, and equity challenges for financial data-driven assessments and intervention methods, as well as provided a broad research agenda to address these challenges. By leveraging objective, personalized financial data in a privacy-preserving and ethical manner help lead to a shift in mental health care.},

	abstract = {Depression is clinically characterized by obvious changes in decision making that cause distress and impairment. Though several studies suggest impairments in depressed individuals in single tasks, there has been no systematic investigation of decision making in depression across tasks. We compare participants diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (n = 64) to healthy controls (n = 64) using a comprehensive battery of nine value-based decision-making tasks which yield ten distinct measures. MDD participants performed worse on punishment (d = −0.54) and reward learning tasks (d = 0.38), expressed more pessimistic predictions regarding winning money in the study (d = −0.47) and were less willing to wait in a persistence task (d = −0.39). Performance on learning, expectation, and persistence tasks each loaded on unique dimensions in a factor analysis and punishment learning and future expectations each accounted for unique variance in predicting depressed status. Decision-making performance alone could predict depressed status out-of-sample with 72\% accuracy. The findings are limited to MDD patients ranging between moderate to severe depression and the effects of medication could not be accounted for due to the cross sectional nature of the study design. These results confirm hints from single task studies that depression has the strongest effects on reinforcement learning and expectations about the future. Our results highlight the decision processes that are impacted in major depression, and whose further study could lead to a more detailed computational understanding of distinct facets of this heterogeneous disorder.},

Objective: To quantify the state of reproducibility of empirical AI research using six reproducibility metrics measuring three different degrees of reproducibility. Hypotheses: 1) AI research is not documented well enough to reproduce the reported results. 2) Documentation practices have improved over time. Method: The literature is reviewed and a set of variables that should be documented to enable reproducibility are grouped into three factors: Experiment, Data and Method. The metrics describe how well the factors have been documented for a paper. A total of 400 research papers from the conference series IJCAI and AAAI have been surveyed using the metrics. Findings: None of the papers document all of the variables. The metrics show that between 20\% and 30\% of the variables for each factor are documented. One of the metrics show statistically signiﬁcant increase over time while the others show no change. Interpretation: The reproducibility scores decrease with increased documentation requirements. Improvement over time is found. Conclusion: Both hypotheses are supported.},

            The booming field of artificial intelligence (AI) is grappling with a replication crisis, much like the ones that have afflicted psychology, medicine, and other fields over the past decade. Just because algorithms are based on code doesn't mean experiments are easily replicated. Far from it. Unpublished codes and a sensitivity to training conditions have made it difficult for AI researchers to reproduce many key results. That is leading to a new conscientiousness about research methods and publication protocols. Last week, at a meeting of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in New Orleans, Louisiana, reproducibility was on the agenda, with some teams diagnosing the problem—and one laying out tools to mitigate it.},

	abstract = {Very large databases are a major opportunity for science and data analytics is a remarkable new ﬁeld of investigation in computer science. The eﬀectiveness of these tools is used to support a “philosophy” against the scientiﬁc method as developed throughout history. According to this view, computer-discovered correlations should replace understanding and guide prediction and action. Consequently, there will be no need to give scientiﬁc meaning to phenomena, by proposing, say, causal relations, since regularities in very large databases are enough: “with enough data, the numbers speak for themselves”. The “end of science” is proclaimed. Using classical results from ergodic theory, Ramsey theory and algorithmic information theory, we show that this “philosophy” is wrong. For example, we prove that very large databases have to contain arbitrary correlations. These correlations appear only due to the size, not the nature, of data. They can be found in “randomly” generated, large enough databases, which – as we will prove – implies that most correlations are spurious. Too much information tends to behave like very little information. The scientiﬁc method can be enriched by computer mining in immense databases, but not replaced by it.},

            A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired.
          , 
            
              INTRODUCTION
              Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.
            
            
              RESULTS
              
                We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and
                P
                values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (
                M
                r
                = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (
                M
                r
                = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (
                P
                {\textless} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.
              
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              
                No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original
                P
                value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.
              
              Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.

We found substantial normative dissonance, particularly between espoused ideals and respondents’ perceptions of other scientists’ typical behavior. Also, respondents on average saw other scientists’ behavior as more counternormative than normative. Scientists’ views of their fields as cooperative or competitive were associated with their normative perspectives, with competitive fields showing more counternormative behavior.

Bernstein limits his interpretation of subjectivity to thinkers such as Gadamer and Habermas. The authors analyze the ideas of classic scholars such as Edmund Husserl and Friedrich Nietzsche. Husserl put forward his notion of transcendental subjectivity and phenomenological ramiﬁcations of the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity. Nietzsche referred to subjectivity as ‘‘perspectivism,’’ the inescapable fact that any and all consciousnesses exist in space and time. Consciousness is fundamentally constituted of cultural, linguistic, and historical dimensions.},

	abstract = {Background:  Digital phenotyping promises to unobtrusively obtaining a continuous and objective input of symp‑tomatology from patients’ daily lives. The prime example are bipolar disorders, as smartphone parameters directly reflect bipolar symptomatology. Empirical studies, however, have yielded inconsistent findings. We believe that three main shortcomings have to be addressed to fully leverage the potential of digital phenotyping: short assessment periods, rare outcome assessments, and an extreme fragmentation of parameters without an integrative analytical strategy. Methods:  To demonstrate how to overcome these shortcomings, we conducted frequent (biweekly) dimensional and categorical expert ratings and daily self-ratings over an extensive assessment period (12 months) in 29 patients with bipolar disorder. Digital phenotypes were monitored continuously. As an integrative analytical strategy, we used structural equation modelling to build latent psychopathological outcomes (mania, depression) and latent digital phenotype predictors (sleep, activity, communicativeness). Outcomes:  Combining gold-standard categorical expert ratings with dimensional self and expert ratings resulted in two latent outcomes (mania and depression) with statistically meaningful factor loadings that dynamically varied over 299 days. Latent digital phenotypes of sleep and activity were associated with same-day latent manic psychopathol‑ogy, suggesting that psychopathological alterations in bipolar disorders relate to domains (latent variables of sleep and activity) and not only to specific behaviors (such as the number of declined incoming calls). The identification of latent psychopathological outcomes that dimensionally vary on a daily basis will enable to empirically determine which combination of digital phenotypes at which days prior to an upcoming episode are viable as digital prodromal predictors.},

Beiwe consists of two native front-end applications: one for Android (written in Java and Kotlin) and one for iOS (written in Swift and Objective-C). The Beiwe back-end, which is based on Amazon Web Services (AWS), has been implemented primarily in Python 3.6, but it also makes use of Django for ORM and Flask for API and web servers. It uses several AWS services, such as S3 for flat file storage, EC2 virtual servers for data processing, Elastic Beanstalk for orchestration, and RDS for PostgreSQL database engine. Most smartphone applications use software development kits (SDKs) that generate unvalidated behavioral summary measures using closed proprietary algorithms. These applications do not meet the high standards of reproducible science, and often require researchers to modify their scientific questions based on what data happens to be available. In contrast, Beiwe collects raw sensor and phone use data, and its data collection parameters can be customized to address specific scientific questions of interest. Collection of raw data also improves reproducibility of studies and enables re-analyses of data and pooling of data across studies. Every aspect of Beiwe data collection is fully customizable, including which sensors to sample, how frequently to sample them, whether to add Gaussian noise to GPS location, whether to use Wi-Fi or cellular data for uploads, how frequently to upload data, specification of surveys and their response options, and skip logic. All study settings are captured in a JSON-formatted configuration file, which can be exported from and imported to Beiwe to enhance transparency and reproducibility of studies.},

The LAMP Consortium has brought together 54 sites from across the world, encouraging collaboration and idea sharing. These sites’ locations range from the USA to the Czech Republic to Australia, and apply the many features of LAMP to research, clinical, research and clinical, and industry use. The most popular features were surveys, sharing/viewing data, and GPS passive data collection. A user support network is necessary to encourage research and clinical use of the LAMP Platform.

We problematize the interpretation of digital phenotypes as straightforward representations of individuals through examples of what we call data inheritance. Rather than being a digital copy of a presumed original, digital phenotypes are shaped by larger data collectives that precede and continuously change how the individual is represented. We contend that looking beyond the individual is crucial for understanding the factors that can ‘bend’ digital mirrors in specific directions. Since algorithms used for digital profiling are based on historical data, their predictions often inherit and increase the values and perspectives of past data practices. Moreover, the data legacies we leave behind today may return as so-called ‘data phantoms’ that conflict with the interests of the individual and contest who and what the ‘original’ is.},

As we will show, the rapid growth of digital phenotyping for mental health raises crucial questions about the values that underpin and are reinforced by this technology, as well as regarding to whom it may become valuable. In this commentary, we explore these questions by focusing on the construction of value across two interrelated domains: user experience and epistemologies on the one hand, and issues of data and ownership on the other. In doing so, we demonstrate the need for a deeper ethical and epistemological engagement with the value assumptions that underpin the promise of digital phenotyping for mental health.},

	abstract = {Amidst the climate of crisis surrounding the rise in opioid-related overdose in the USA, early in 2019, Google and Deloitte launched ‘Opioid360’. Here came a platform combining browser histories, credit, insurance, social media, and traditional survey data to sell the service of risk calculation in population health. Opioid360's approach to automating risk calculation not only promised to identify persons ‘at risk’ of opioid dependence, but also paved the way for broader applications anticipating common chronic diseases and coordinating logistical operations involved in pandemic response. Beginning with this experimental platform, this paper develops an analysis of the Big Data mode of risk calculation - an epistemological and political shift that involves technology companies, investors, insurers, governments, and public health institutions. The analysis focuses on the re-emergence of ‘social determinants of health’ (SDOH) in the rhetoric accompanying novel analytic platforms that estimate, calculate, and compute individual health risks. While the treatment of SDOH has always been a site of political contestation within the discipline of public health, powerful interests are crystallising around the concept and instrumentalising it in platforms that sell algorithmic prediction. Silicon Valley's breed of asset-oriented technoscience appears not only to be amplifying the behaviouralist elements of public health. Among the stakes of the Big Data mode is the paradoxical retreat from changing social conditions that contribute to the prevalence of health and illness in populations; and instead, the promotion of an apparatus for pricing and exchanging individual risk or excluding from services those who bear risk most acutely.},

It outlines different ways of data collection and production and the consequences thereof. Second, it shows how these sorts of data influence dominant beliefs in the field: The field of precision medicine relying on the dominant understanding of ‘genetic determinism’ imported from genetics, digital phenotyping building on the logic of ‘data fundamentalism’. In the end, the analysis shows how digital data informs potentials as well as challenges of precision medicine and digital phenotyping: a better health care for (some) individuals connected with individualisation and responsibilisation for all, with a prognosed shift from reactive to preventive medicine. Additionally, data-based approaches might facilitate epistemological and ontological redirections for the whole field of medicine that will also affect knowledge production and a reassessment of the value of different types of knowledge (quantifiable vs. non-quantifiable) with all its consequences. Institutionally, it might lead to shifts in distribution of power to experts in big data related technologies, i.e. private companies.},

Contributors to this literature tend to take a cognitive or behavioural psychology approach to theorising and explaining self-tracking. Such an approach is limited to understanding individual behaviour. Yet self-tracking is a profoundly social practice, both in terms of the enculturated meanings with which it is invested and the social encounters and social institutions that are part of the self-tracking phenomenon. In this paper I contend that sociological perspectives can contribute some intriguing possibilities for human-computer interaction research, particularly in developing an understanding of the wider social, cultural and political dimensions of what I refer to as 'self-tracking cultures'. The discussion focuses on the following topics: self-optimisation and governing the self; entanglements of bodies and technologies; the valorisation of data; data doubles; and social inequalities and self-tracking. The paper ends with outlining some directions for future research on self-tracking cultures that goes beyond the individual to the social.},

They argue that the history of privacy shows that privacy is an ever-changing and context-dependent phenomenon. As such, opportunities for and threats to privacy are highly related to broader societal developments. Several of these broader developments are been distinguished and discussed and we briefly sum them up here. First, changing morals, cultural and religious ideas about the individual, family, household, and ‘natural’ relationships have had an efffect on individual privacy. Second, privacy has been influenced throughout history by political changes, especially the rise of the idea of private individual rights and the acceptance of an individual sphere that the state, society, and legal system should respect and protect. Furthermore, the development of liberal-democracies – with individual freedom and the non-interference principle as its core values – and the internationalization of human rights in the past decades, have had a big impact on the politics and history of privacy. Finally, as the fĳirst but certainly not the only chapter to address the fact that technological changes, especially in the fĳield of infrastructure, media, and communication, have had and will have great impact on privacy matters.

            In recent years, the number of digital health tools with the potential to significantly improve delivery of healthcare services has grown tremendously. However, the use of these tools in large, complex health systems remains comparatively limited. The adoption and implementation of digital health tools at an enterprise level is a challenge; few strategies exist to help tools cross the chasm from clinical validation to integration within the workflows of a large health system. Many previously proposed frameworks for digital health implementation are difficult to operationalize in these dynamic organizations. In this piece, we put forth nine dimensions along which clinically validated digital health tools should be examined by health systems prior to adoption, and propose strategies for selecting digital health tools and planning for implementation in this setting. By evaluating prospective tools along these dimensions, health systems can evaluate which existing digital health solutions are worthy of adoption, ensure they have sufficient resources for deployment and long-term use, and devise a strategic plan for implementation.},

	abstract = {In mental health disorder, Bipolar Disorder (BD) is one of the most common mental illness. Using rating scales for assessment is one of the approaches for diagnosing and tracking BD patients. However, the requirement for manpower and time is heavy in the process of evaluation. In order to reduce the cost of social and medical resources, this study collects the user’s data by the App on smartphones, consisting of location data (GPS), self-report scales, daily mood, sleeping time and records of multi-media (text, speech, video) which are heterogeneous digital phenotyping data, to build a database. The features of each heterogeneous digital phenotyping data are extracted independently. Lasso Regression and ElasticNet Regression methods are employed to predict the score of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), as a reference for the evaluation of BD. As incomplete and missing data are very common in medical research, the ensemble method is adopted to combine the results from different models trained with different combinations of missing data. The collected heterogeneous digital phenotyping data from 84 BD patients were used for training and evaluation of the proposed approach based on five-fold cross validation method. Experimental results show that the performance of the assessment system using the proposed method are encouraging.},

	abstract = {Managing a pandemic requires continuous dissemination of infectious disease surveillance data. Legislation permits sharing de-identified patient data; however, current de-identification approaches are time-consuming and do not flex with changes in infection rates or population demographics over time. In this paper, we introduce a framework to dynamically adapt de-identification for near-real time sharing of patient-level surveillance data. The framework leverages a simulation mechanism, capable of being applied to any geographic level, to forecast and manage disclosure risks. We use data from Johns Hopkins University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in maintaining the privacy risk below a threshold based on public health standards for COVID-19 county-level case data from August 2020 to April 2021. Across all US counties, the framework's approach meets the threshold for 95.2\% of daily data releases, while a policy based on current de-identification techniques meets the threshold for only 24.6\%.},

In turn, these technologies present new challenges and opportunities for firms, which warrant further academic research.

Such data may help marketers generate insights about customers and competitors. One fundamental question remains: How can marketers wrestle massive flows of existing and nascent data resources into coherent, effective growth strategies? Against such a backdrop, the Marketing Science Institute has made ?capturing information to fuel growth? a top research priority. The authors begin by discussing the streetlight effect?an overreliance on readily available data due to ease of measurement and application?as contributing to the disconnect between marketing data growth and firm growth. They then use the customer equity framework to structure the discussion of six areas where they see substantial undertapped opportunities: incorporating social network and biometric data in customer acquisition, trend and competitive interaction data in customer development, and unstructured and causal data in customer retention. The authors highlight challenges that obstruct firms from realizing such data-driven growth opportunities and how future research may help overcome those challenges.},

In this paper, we investigate using three ﬁeld tests the accuracy of a variety of demographic and audienceinterest segments. We examine the accuracy of more than 90 third-party audiences across 19 data brokers. Audience segments vary greatly in quality and are often inaccurate across leading data brokers. In comparison with random audience selection, the use of black box data proﬁles, on average, increased identiﬁcation of a user with a desired single attribute by 0\%–77\%. Audience identiﬁcation can be improved, on average, by 123\% when combined with optimization software. However, given the high extra costs of targeting solutions and the relative inaccuracy, we ﬁnd that third-party audiences are often economically unattractive except for higher-priced media placements.},

	abstract = {Background: Although patient history is essential for informing mental health assessment, diagnosis, and prognosis, there is a dearth of standardized instruments measuring time-dependent factors relevant to psychiatric disorders. Previous research has demonstrated the potential utility of graphical representations, termed life charts, for depicting the complexity of the course of mental illness. However, the implementation of these assessments is limited by the exclusive focus on specific mental illnesses (ie, bipolar disorder) and the lack of intuitive graphical interfaces for data collection and visualization.
Objective: This study aimed to develop and test the utility of the Tulsa Life Chart (TLC) as a Web-based, structured approach for obtaining and graphically representing historical information on psychosocial and mental health events relevant across a spectrum of psychiatric disorders.
Methods: The TLC interview was completed at baseline by 499 participants of the Tulsa 1000, a longitudinal study of individuals with depressive, anxiety, substance use, or eating disorders and healthy comparisons (HCs). All data were entered electronically, and a 1-page electronic and interactive graphical representation was developed using the Google Visualization Application Programming Interface. For 8 distinct life epochs (periods of approximately 5-10 years), the TLC assessed the following factors: school attendance, hobbies, jobs, social support, substance use, mental health treatment, family structure changes, negative and positive events, and epoch and event-related mood ratings. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to evaluate trajectories of each domain over time and by sex, age, and diagnosis, using case examples and Web-based interactive graphs to visualize data.
Results: GLMM analyses revealed main or interaction effects of epoch and diagnosis for all domains. Epoch by diagnosis interactions were identified for mood ratings and the number of negative-versus-positive events (all P values \&lt;.001), with all psychiatric groups reporting worse mood and greater negative-versus-positive events than HCs. These differences were most robust at different epochs, depending on diagnosis. There were also diagnosis and epoch main effects for substance use, mental health treatment received, social support, and hobbies (P\&lt;.001). User experience ratings (each on a 1-5 scale) revealed that participants found the TLC pleasant to complete (mean 3.07, SD 1.26) and useful for understanding their mental health (mean 3.07, SD 1.26), and that they were likely to recommend it to others (mean 3.42, SD 0.85).
Conclusions: The TLC provides a structured, Web-based transdiagnostic assessment of psychosocial history relevant for the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Interactive, 1-page graphical representations of the TLC allow for the efficient communication of historical life information that would be useful for clinicians, patients, and family members.},

A deeper and more adequate understanding of autonomy has evolved in the philosophical literature, specifically in deontological ethics. It teaches that ethics is an internal, not an external, constraint on autonomy, and that a truly autonomous agent must be ethical.

	doi = {10.2196/31146},
	abstract = {Background: Psychiatry has long needed a better and more scalable way to capture the dynamics of behavior and its disturbances, quantitatively across multiple data channels, at high temporal resolution in real time. By combining 24/7 data—on location, movement, email and text communications, and social media—with brain scans, genetics, genomics, neuropsychological batteries, and clinical interviews, researchers will have an unprecedented amount of objective, individual-level data. Analyzing these data with ever-evolving artificial intelligence could one day include bringing interventions to patients where they are in the real world in a convenient, efficient, effective, and timely way. Yet, the road to this innovative future is fraught with ethical dilemmas as well as ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI).
Objective: The goal of the Ethics Checklist is to promote careful design and execution of research. It is not meant to mandate particular research designs; indeed, at this early stage and without consensus guidance, there are a range of reasonable choices researchers may make. However, the checklist is meant to make those ethical choices explicit, and to require researchers to give reasons for their decisions related to ELSI issues. The Ethics Checklist is primarily focused on procedural safeguards, such as consulting with experts outside the research group and documenting standard operating procedures for clearly actionable data (eg, expressed suicidality) within written research protocols.
Methods: We explored the ELSI of digital health research in psychiatry, with a particular focus on what we label “deep phenotyping” psychiatric research, which combines the potential for virtually boundless data collection and increasingly sophisticated techniques to analyze those data. We convened an interdisciplinary expert stakeholder workshop in May 2020, and this checklist emerges out of that dialogue.
Results: Consistent with recent ELSI analyses, we find that existing ethical guidance and legal regulations are not sufficient for deep phenotyping research in psychiatry. At present, there are regulatory gaps, inconsistencies across research teams in ethics protocols, and a lack of consensus among institutional review boards on when and how deep phenotyping research should proceed. We thus developed a new instrument, an Ethics Checklist for Digital Health Research in Psychiatry (“the Ethics Checklist”). The Ethics Checklist is composed of 20 key questions, subdivided into 6 interrelated domains: (1) informed consent; (2) equity, diversity, and access; (3) privacy and partnerships; (4) regulation and law; (5) return of results; and (6) duty to warn and duty to report.
Conclusions: Deep phenotyping research offers a vision for vastly more effective care for people with, or at risk for, psychiatric disease. The potential perils en route to realizing this vision are significant; however, and researchers must be willing to address the questions in the Ethics Checklist before embarking on each leg of the journey.},

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed the emergence of massive mobility data sets, such as tracks generated by GPS devices, call detail records, and geo-tagged posts from social media platforms. These data sets have fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering the statistical "laws" that govern human movements. A significant effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the re-identification of individuals in a database. A view on state of the art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis. In this paper, we propose scikit-mobility, a Python library that has the ambition of providing an environment to reproduce existing research, analyze mobility data, and simulate human mobility habits. scikit-mobility is efficient and easy to use as it extends pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis. Moreover, scikit-mobility provides the user with many functionalities, from visualizing trajectories to generating synthetic data, from analyzing statistical patterns to assessing the privacy risk related to the analysis of mobility data sets.},

As the term progresses and the workload increases, stress appreciably rises while positive affect, sleep, conversation and activity drops off.

Hence, the mass market share of LBS depends on how well the privacy of citizens can be protected. In this article, we specifically study the privacy issues in LBSs. In detail, we start with classifying different types of LBSs and analyzing the privacy leakage presented in each type. After summarizing the state-of-the-art work on location privacy and query privacy, we propose a query content preservation approach with the aim of providing accurate LBS answer with zero server knowledge on query content.

	abstract = {Objectives To test the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a Smartphone-based self-management tool in Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services.
Design A two-arm unblinded feasibility RCT.
Setting Six NHS EIP services in England.
Participants Adults using EIP services who own an Android Smartphone. Participants were recruited until the recruitment target was met (n=40).
Interventions Participants were randomised with a 1:1 allocation to one of two conditions: (1) treatment as usual from EIP services (TAU) or (2) TAU plus access to My Journey 3 on their own Smartphone. My Journey 3 features a range of self-management components including access to digital recovery and relapse prevention plans, medication tracking and symptom monitoring. My Journey 3 use was at the users’ discretion and was supported by EIP service clinicians. Participants had access for a median of 38.1 weeks.
Primary and secondary outcome measures Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, follow-up rates and intervention engagement. Participant data on mental health outcomes were collected from clinical records and from research assessments at baseline, 4 months and 12 months.
Results 83\% and 75\% of participants were retained in the trial at the 4-month and 12-month assessments. All treatment group participants had access to My Journey 3 during the trial, but technical difficulties caused delays in ensuring timely access to the intervention. The median number of My Journey 3 uses was 16.5 (IQR 8.5 to 23) and median total minutes spent using My Journey 3 was 26.8 (IQR 18.3 to 57.3). No serious adverse events were reported.
Conclusions Recruitment and retention were feasible. Within a trial context, My Journey 3 could be successfully delivered to adults using EIP services, but with relatively low usage rates. Further evaluation of the intervention in a larger trial may be warranted, but should include attention to implementation.

Our investigation of smartphone-based anomaly detection resulted in 89\% sensitivity and 75\% specificity for predicting relapse in schizophrenia. These results demonstrate the potential of longitudinal collection of real-time behavior and symptomatology via smartphones and the clinical utility of individualized analysis.

	abstract = {Background: Digital mental health interventions present a unique opportunity to address the lack of social connection and loneliness experienced by young people with first-episode psychosis (FEP). The first generation of digital interventions, however, is associated with high attrition rates. Social media presents an opportunity to target this issue. A new generation of digital intervention has harnessed the popularity of social media to both promote engagement and foster social connectedness in youth mental health interventions. Despite their potential, little is known about how young people engage with, and experience, social media–based interventions as well as the optimal design, implementation, and management needed to ensure young people with psychosis receive benefit.
Objective: This study aimed to explore how young people engage with, and experience, a long-term social media–based mental health intervention designed to address social functioning in individuals with FEP.
Methods: This qualitative study was based on 12 interviews with young people who used Horyzons, a long-term social media–based mental health intervention, as part of a previous randomized controlled trial. A semistructured phenomenological interview guide with open-ended questions was used to explore young people’s subjective experience of the intervention. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.
Results: A total of 4 superordinate themes emerged during the analysis including (1) shared experience as the catalyst for a cocreated social space, (2) the power of peer support, (3) an upbeat environment, and (4) experiences that interrupt being in Horyzons.
Conclusions: We found that Horyzon’s therapeutic social network fostered a connection and an understanding among young people. It also aided in the creation of an embodied experience that afforded young people with FEP a sense of self-recognition and belonging over the long term. However, although we found that most young people had strong positive experiences of a social connection on Horyzons, we also found that they experienced significant barriers that could substantively interrupt their ability to use the platform. We found that social anxiety, paranoia, internalized stigma, lack of autonomy, and social protocol confusion interfered with young people’s usage of the platform. From a design perspective, digital interventions are flexible and thus equipped to begin addressing these implications by providing customizable and personalized treatment options that account for varying levels of social connection and psychological need that could otherwise interrupt young people’s usage of social media–based interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is the 10th most common cause of frailty in young individuals and has triggered morbidity and mortality worldwide. Patients with BD have a life expectancy 9 to 17 years lower than that of normal people. BD is a predominant mental disorder, but it can be misdiagnosed as depressive disorder, which leads to difficulties in treating affected patients. Approximately 60\% of patients with BD are treated for depression. However, machine learning provides advanced skills and techniques for better diagnosis of BD.
Objective: This review aims to explore the machine learning algorithms used for the detection and diagnosis of bipolar disorder and its subtypes.
Methods: The study protocol adopted the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We explored 3 databases, namely Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. To enhance the search, we performed backward screening of all the references of the included studies. Based on the predefined selection criteria, 2 levels of screening were performed: title and abstract review, and full review of the articles that met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed independently by all investigators. To synthesize the extracted data, a narrative synthesis approach was followed.
Results: We retrieved 573 potential articles were from the 3 databases. After preprocessing and screening, only 33 articles that met our inclusion criteria were identified. The most commonly used data belonged to the clinical category (19, 58\%). We identified different machine learning models used in the selected studies, including classification models (18, 55\%), regression models (5, 16\%), model-based clustering methods (2, 6\%), natural language processing (1, 3\%), clustering algorithms (1, 3\%), and deep learning–based models (3, 9\%). Magnetic resonance imaging data were most commonly used for classifying bipolar patients compared to other groups (11, 34\%), whereas microarray expression data sets and genomic data were the least commonly used. The maximum ratio of accuracy was 98\%, whereas the minimum accuracy range was 64\%.
Conclusions: This scoping review provides an overview of recent studies based on machine learning models used to diagnose patients with BD regardless of their demographics or if they were compared to patients with psychiatric diagnoses. Further research can be conducted to provide clinical decision support in the health industry.},

Unfortunately, most traditional metrics fall short in addressing this task as they either focus on rare actions like shots and goals alone or fail to account for the context in which the actions occurred. This paper introduces (1) a new language for describing individual player actions on the pitch and (2) a framework for valuing any type of player action based on its impact on the game outcome while accounting for the context in which the action happened. By aggregating soccer players’ action values, their total offensive and defensive contributions to their team can be quantified. We show how our approach considers relevant contextual information that traditional player evaluation metrics ignore and present a number of use cases related to scouting and playing style characterization in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 seasons in Europe’s top competitions.},

This paper investigates practices of image data annotation as performed in industrial contexts. We define data annotation as a sense-making practice, where annotators assign meaning to data through the use of labels. Previous human-centered investigations have largely focused on annotators’ subjectivity as a major cause of biased labels. We propose a wider view on this issue: guided by constructivist grounded theory, we conducted several weeks of fieldwork at two annotation companies. We analyzed which structures, power relations, and naturalized impositions shape the interpretation of data. Our results show that the work of annotators is profoundly informed by the interests, values, and priorities of other actors above their station. Arbitrary classifications are vertically imposed on annotators, and through them, on data. This imposition is largely naturalized. Assigning meaning to data is often presented as a technical matter. This paper shows it is, in fact, an exercise of power with multiple implications for individuals and society.

However, the signiﬁcance of privacy policies greatly exceeds the attention paid to them: these documents are binding legal agreements between website operators and their users, and their opaqueness is a challenge not only to Internet users but also to policy regulators. One proposed alternative to the status quo is to automate or semi-automate the extraction of salient details from privacy policy text, using a combination of crowdsourcing, natural language processing, and machine learning. However, there has been a relative dearth of datasets appropriate for identifying data practices in privacy policies. To remedy this problem, we introduce a corpus of 115 privacy policies (267K words) with manual annotations for 23K ﬁne-grained data practices. We describe the process of using skilled annotators and a purpose-built annotation tool to produce the data. We provide ﬁndings based on a census of the annotations and show results toward automating the annotation procedure. Finally, we describe challenges and opportunities for the research community to use this corpus to advance research in both privacy and language technologies.},

	abstract = {Sentiment analysis from text consists of extracting information about opinions, sentiments, and even emotions conveyed by writers towards topics of interest. It is often equated to opinion mining, but it should also encompass emotion mining. Opinion mining involves the use of natural language processing and machine learning to determine the attitude of a writer towards a subject. Emotion mining is also using similar technologies but is concerned with detecting and classifying writers emotions toward events or topics. Textual emotion-mining methods have various applications, including gaining information about customer satisfaction, helping in selecting teaching materials in e-learning, recommending products based on users emotions, and even predicting mental-health disorders. In surveys on sentiment analysis, which are often old or incomplete, the strong link between opinion mining and emotion mining is understated. This motivates the need for a different and new perspective on the literature on sentiment analysis, with a focus on emotion mining. We present the state-of-the-art methods and propose the following contributions: (1) a taxonomy of sentiment analysis; (2) a survey on polarity classification methods and resources, especially those related to emotion mining; (3) a complete survey on emotion theories and emotion-mining research; and (4) some useful resources, including lexicons and datasets.},

Moreover, adapting to the task’s unlabeled data (task-adaptive pretraining) improves performance even after domain-adaptive pretraining. Finally, we show that adapting to a task corpus augmented using simple data selection strategies is an effective alternative, especially when resources for domain-adaptive pretraining might be unavailable. Overall, we consistently ﬁnd that multiphase adaptive pretraining offers large gains in task performance.},

Facial analysis technologies are particularly pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new technical systems. What facial analysis technologies can do is determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. In this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. We found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. Further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. Instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. We discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. We posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. We conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications.},

Furthermore, new paradigms, such as interactive planning and end-to-end learning, open up questions regarding safety and reliability that need to be addressed.

Prior research has been limited to analysis of privacy policies from a single point in time or from short spans of time, as researchers did not have access to a large-scale, longitudinal, curated dataset. To address this gap, we developed a crawler that discovers, downloads, and extracts archived privacy policies from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Using the crawler and following a series of validation and quality control steps, we curated a dataset of 1,071,488 English language privacy policies, spanning over two decades and over 130,000 distinct websites.},

	abstract = {The field of machine learning is witnessing its golden era as deep learning slowly becomes the leader in this domain. Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models. Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing. However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective. The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level. Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth. This article presents a comprehensive review of historical and recent state-of-the-art approaches in visual, audio, and text processing; social network analysis; and natural language processing, followed by the in-depth analysis on pivoting and groundbreaking advances in deep learning applications. It was also undertaken to review the issues faced in deep learning such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning and to illustrate how these challenges can be transformed into prolific future research avenues.},

In our paper, we focus on using Twitter, the most popular microblogging platform, for the task of sentiment analysis. We show how to automatically collect a corpus for sentiment analysis and opinion mining purposes. We perform linguistic analysis of the collected corpus and explain discovered phenomena. Using the corpus, we build a sentiment classiﬁer, that is able to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments for a document. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed techniques are efﬁcient and performs better than previously proposed methods.

Using a dataset of 118 Oxford-style debates, our model’s combination of content (as latent topics) and style (as linguistic features) allows us to predict audience-adjudicated winners with 74\% accuracy, signiﬁcantly outperforming linguistic features alone (66\%). Our model ﬁnds that winning sides employ stronger arguments, and allows us to identify the linguistic features associated with strong or weak arguments.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, none of relevant studies have performed a qualitative and quantitative comparison and analysis of the complex topic of designing countermeasures and discussed the viability of their use with different kinds of services and the potential elements that could be deployed to meet new challenges. Accordingly, the purpose of this survey is to examine the privacy-preserving techniques in LBSs. We categorize and provide an inside-out review of the existing techniques. Performing a retrospective analysis of several typical studies in each category, we summarize their basic principles and recent advances. Additionally, we highlight the use of privacy-preserving techniques in LBSs for enabling new research opportunities.

Although trajectory data can generate valuable insights and value-added services for many, publishing this data while respecting mobile users' privacy has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we present DP-Star, a methodical framework for publishing trajectory data with differential privacy guarantee as well as high utility preservation. DP-Star relies on a novel combination of several components. First, DP-Star's normalization algorithm uses the Minimum Description Length metric to summarize raw trajectories using their representative points, thereby achieving a desirable trade-off between the preciseness and conciseness of their information content. Second, DP-Star constructs a density-aware grid which ensures spatial densities can be preserved despite the noise added to satisfy differential privacy. Third, DP-Star preserves the correlations between trajectories' end points through a private trip distribution, and intermediate points through a private Markov mobility model. Finally, DP-Star estimates users' trip lengths using a median length estimation method, and generates synthetic trajectories that preserve both differential privacy and high utility. Our experimental comparison shows that DP-Star significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of trajectory utility and accuracy.},

	abstract = {Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.},

The purpose of this work was to develop a method to validate the advice of a computer by estimating the error of an artificial neural network output. A total of 1249 ECGs, recorded with computerized electrocardiographs, on patients who had undergone diagnostic cardiac catheterization were studied. The material consisted of two groups, 414 patients with and 835 without anterior myocardial infarction. The material was randomly divided into three data sets. The first set was used to train an artificial neural network for the diagnosis of anterior infarction. The second data set was used to calculate the error of the network outputs. The last data set was used to test the network performance and to estimate the error of the network outputs. The performance of the neural network, measured as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, was 0·887 (0·845–0·922). The 25\% test ECGs with the lowest error estimates had an area under the ROC curve as high as 0·995 (0·982–1·000), i.e. almost all of these ECGs were correctly classified. Neural networks can therefore be trained to diagnose myocardial infarction and to signal when the advice is given with great confidence or when it should be considered more carefully. This method increases the possibility that artificial neural networks will be accepted as reliable decision support systems in clinical practice.},

The database was the first generally available set of standard test material for evaluation of arrhythmia detectors, and has been used for that purpose as well as for basic research into cardiac dynamics at more than 500 sites worldwide. Originally, we distributed the database on 9-track half-inch digital tape at 800 and 1600 bpi, and on quarter-inch IRIG-format FM analog tape. In August, 1989, we produced a CD-ROM version of the database.},

While these worries are familiar to privacy researchers, this paper aims to make them more salient to policymakers—first, by defining “online manipulation”, thus enabling identification of manipulative practices; and second, by drawing attention to the specific harms online manipulation threatens. We argue that online manipulation is the use of information technology to covertly influence another person’s decision-making, by targeting and exploiting their decision-making vulnerabilities. Engaging in such practices can harm individuals by diminishing their economic interests, but its deeper, more insidious harm is its challenge to individual autonomy. We explore this autonomy harm, emphasising its implications for both individuals and society, and we briefly outline some strategies for combating online manipulation and strengthening autonomy in an increasingly digital world.},

However, the design of health tracking technologies typically focuses on individual self-tracking and self-management, not yet addressing family health in a unified way. To examine opportunities for family-centered health informatics, we interviewed 14 typically healthy families, interviewed 10 families with a child with a chronic condition, and conducted three participatory design sessions with children aged 7 to 11. Although we identified similarities between family-centered tracking and personal self-tracking, we also found families want to: (1) identify ripple effects between family members; (2) consider both caregivers and children as trackers to support distributing the burdens of tracking across family members; and (3) identify and pursue health guidelines that consider the state of their family (e.g., specific health guidelines for families that include a child with a chronic condition). We contribute to expanding the design lens from self-tracking to family-centered health tracking.},

	abstract = {Human behavior is increasingly reflected or acted out through technology. This is of particular salience when it comes to changes in behavior associated with serious mental illnesses including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Early detection is crucial for these conditions but presently very challenging to achieve. Potentially, characteristics of these conditions' traits and symptoms, at both idiosyncratic and collective levels, may be detectable through technology use patterns. In bipolar disorder specifically, initial evidence associates changes in mood with changes in technology-mediated communication patterns. However much less is known about how people with bipolar disorder use technology more generally in their lives, how they view their technology use in relation to their illness, and, perhaps most crucially, the causal relationship (if any exists) between their technology use and their disease. To address these uncertainties, we conducted a survey of people with bipolar disorder (N = 84). Our results indicate that technology use varies markedly with changes in mood and that technology use broadly may have potential as an early warning signal of mood episodes. We also find that technology for many of these participants is a double-edged sword: acting as both a culprit that can trigger or exacerbate symptoms as well as a support mechanism for recovery. These findings have implications for the design of both early warning systems and technology-mediated interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: For many people, tracking health indicators is central to managing a chronic illness. However, previous informatics research has largely viewed tracking as a solitary process that lacks the characteristics essential to tracking in support of chronic illness management.
Objective: To inform development of effective technologies that aid tracking of health indicators to support chronic illness management, this study aimed to construct a health informatics model that accurately describes the work and social context of that tracking work.
Methods: As part of a larger project, we conducted semistructured interviews with 40 adults concerning their chronic illness management practices, including tracking and communication. We also assembled transcripts of 30 publicly available videos of 24 adults discussing tracking processes for managing their own chronic illness. We used qualitative methods to analyze interviews and video transcripts through the lens of ongoing personal and health informatics research.
Results: We have described the people and work involved in tracking in support of chronic illness management and contributed a Conceptual Model of Shared Health Informatics (CoMSHI). Specifically, we identified the need for a health informatics model that (1) incorporates the ongoing nature of tracking work and (2) represents the social dimension of tracking for illness management. Our model depicts communication, information, collection, integration, reflection, and action work in the social context of the person with chronic illness, informal carers, health care providers, and community members.
Conclusions: The resulting CoMSHI yields a more detailed and nuanced viewpoint of tracking in support of chronic illness management and can inform technology design to improve tracking tools to support people in more confident and capable chronic illness management.},

We focus on the case of personal data related to the self-tracking of bipolar disorder (BD) in order to explore the ways in which disclosure activities intersect with other privacy experiences. While research in HCI often discusses privacy as a disclosure activity, this does not reﬂect the ways in which privacy can be passively experienced. In this paper we broaden conceptions of privacy by deﬁning transparency experiences and contributing factors in contrast to disclosure activities and preferences. Next, we ground this theoretical move in empirical analysis of personal narratives shared by people managing BD. We discuss the resulting emergent model of transparency in terms of implications for the design of socially-enabled PI systems.

	abstract = {Objective: This paper aims to identify periods of depression using geolocation movements recorded from mobile phones in a prospective community study of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: Anonymized geographic location recordings from 22 BD participants and 14 healthy controls (HC) were collected over 3 months. Participants reported their depressive symptomatology using a weekly questionnaire (QIDS-SR16). Recorded location data were preprocessed by detecting and removing imprecise data points and features were extracted to assess the level and regularity of geographic movements of the participant. A subset of features were selected using a wrapper feature selection method and presented to 1) a linear regression model and a quadratic generalized linear model with a logistic link function for questionnaire score estimation; and 2) a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier for depression detection in BD participants based on their questionnaire responses. Results: HC participants did not report depressive symptoms and their features showed similar distributions to nondepressed BD participants. Questionnaire score estimation using geolocation-derived features from BD participants demonstrated an optimal mean absolute error rate of 3.73, while depression detection demonstrated an optimal (median ± IQR) F1 score of 0.857 ± 0.022 using five features (classification accuracy: 0.849 ± 0.016; sensitivity: 0.839 ± 0.014; specificity: 0.872 ± 0.047). Conclusion: These results demonstrate a strong link between geographic movements and depression in bipolar disorder. Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first community study of passively recorded objective markers of depression in bipolar disorder of this scale. The techniques could help individuals monitor their depression and enable healthcare providers to detect those in need of care or treatment.},

Second, facilitated by new technologies, it is increasingly apparent that the bipolar phenotype is more complex and nuanced than simply one of recurring manic and depressive episodes. One such feature is persistent mood instability, and efforts are underway to understand its mechanisms and its therapeutic potential.

The resulting model is then distributed back to all clients, ultimately converging to a joint representative model without explicitly having to share the data. However, the protocol is vulnerable to differential attacks, which could originate from any party contributing during federated optimization. In such an attack, a client's contribution during training and information about their data set is revealed through analyzing the distributed model. We tackle this problem and propose an algorithm for client sided differential privacy preserving federated optimization. The aim is to hide clients' contributions during training, balancing the trade-off between privacy loss and model performance. Empirical studies suggest that given a sufficiently large number of participating clients, our proposed procedure can maintain client-level differential privacy at only a minor cost in model performance.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are state-of-the-art distributed machine learning techniques to enable machine learning training without accessing raw data on clients or end devices. However, their {\textbackslash}emph\{comparative training performance\} under real-world resource-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) device settings, e.g., Raspberry Pi, remains barely studied, which, to our knowledge, have not yet been evaluated and compared, rendering inconvenient reference for practitioners. This work firstly provides empirical comparisons of FL and SL in real-world IoT settings regarding (i) learning performance with heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) on-device execution overhead. Our analyses in this work demonstrate that the learning performance of SL is better than FL under an imbalanced data distribution but worse than FL under an extreme non-IID data distribution. Recently, FL and SL are combined to form splitfed learning (SFL) to leverage each of their benefits (e.g., parallel training of FL and lightweight on-device computation requirement of SL). This work then considers FL, SL, and SFL, and mount them on Raspberry Pi devices to evaluate their performance, including training time, communication overhead, power consumption, and memory usage. Besides evaluations, we apply two optimizations. Firstly, we generalize SFL by carefully examining the possibility of a hybrid type of model training at the server-side. The generalized SFL merges sequential (dependent) and parallel (independent) processes of model training and is thus beneficial for a system with large-scaled IoT devices, specifically at the server-side operations. Secondly, we propose pragmatic techniques to substantially reduce the communication overhead by up to four times for the SL and (generalized) SFL.},

Due to data privacy regulations and limited communication bandwidth, it is infeasible to collect, transmit, and store all data from mobile devices at a central location. To overcome this challenge, we propose FedADMP, a federated learning based joint Anomaly Detection and Mobility Prediction framework. FedADMP adaptively splits the training process between the server and clients to reduce computation loads on clients. To protect the privacy of user data, clients in FedADMP upload only intermediate model parameters to the cloud server. We also develop a differential privacy method to prevent the cloud server and external attackers from inferring private information during the model upload procedure. Extensive experiments using real-world datasets show that FedADMP consistently outperforms existing methods.},

The framework offers two levels of privacy protection. First, it does not move or share raw data across sites or with a centralized server during the model training process. Second, it uses a differential privacy mechanism to further protect the model from potential privacy attacks. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of our approach on two healthcare applications, using real-world electronic health data of 1 million patients. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the federated learning framework in offering an elevated level of privacy and maintaining utility of the global model.},

This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example, different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse, “big data.” Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions to the statistical challenges, system challenges, and privacy issues in federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in healthcare.},

            Data-driven machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach for building accurate and robust statistical models from medical data, which is collected in huge volumes by modern healthcare systems. Existing medical data is not fully exploited by ML primarily because it sits in data silos and privacy concerns restrict access to this data. However, without access to sufficient data, ML will be prevented from reaching its full potential and, ultimately, from making the transition from research to clinical practice. This paper considers key factors contributing to this issue, explores how federated learning (FL) may provide a solution for the future of digital health and highlights the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed.},

Those connected sensors can potentially be exploited by third parties who want to misuse personal information and compromise the security, which could ultimately result even in patient death. This paper addresses the security concerns in eHealth networks and suggests a new approach to dealing with anomalies. In particular we propose a concept for safe in-hospital learning from internet of health things (IoHT) device data while securing the network traffic with a collaboratively trained anomaly detection system using federated learning. That way, real time traffic anomaly detection is achieved, while maintaining collaboration between hospitals and keeping local data secure and private. Since not only the network metadata, but also the actual medical data is relevant to anomaly detection, we propose to use differential privacy (DP) for providing formal guarantees of the privacy spending accumulated during the federated learning.},

However, in the case of sensitive healthcare datasets, additional privacy measures before feeding into machine learning mechanisms are also necessary. Our approach uses the federated learning framework, which removes the necessity of sharing patients' sensitive data in a raw format outside the premise. First, the data owners agree on a list of features selected by the correlation; then, after training the local models, the obtained local models are transmitted to the central server for aggregation. The differential privacy (DP) approach is adopted to perturb the local models before transmission to add an extra privacy layer. As a result, our framework achieves improved utility as the feature selection reduces the data dimension. Finally, based on the patient's genomic data, the framework establishes a practical healthcare application to privacy-predict certain heart failure/cancer diseases. application to predict certain heart failure diseases in a private manner.},

Existing LDP protocols are developed primarily to ensure data privacy in the collection of single numerical or categorical values, such as click count in Web access logs. However, in federated learning model parameter updates are collected iteratively from each participant and consist of high dimensional, continuous values with high precision (10s of digits after the decimal point), making existing LDP protocols inapplicable. To address this challenge in LDP-Fed, we design and develop two novel approaches. First, LDP-Fed's LDP Module provides a formal differential privacy guarantee for the repeated collection of model training parameters in the federated training of large-scale neural networks over multiple individual participants' private datasets. Second, LDP-Fed implements a suite of selection and filtering techniques for perturbing and sharing select parameter updates with the parameter server. We validate our system deployed with a condensed LDP protocol in training deep neural networks on public data. We compare this version of LDP-Fed, coined CLDP-Fed, with other state-of-the-art approaches with respect to model accuracy, privacy preservation, and system capabilities.},

We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and active adversary settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools.

	abstract = {Introduction“Advance decision making” (ADM) refers to people planning for a future when they may lose the capacity to make decisions about treatment (decision making capacity for treatment or DMC-T). This can occur in a variety of physical and mental health scenarios. Statutory provision for ADM is likely to be introduced to mental health legislation in England and Wales, which will support planning for mental health crises. Conceptually, it may have particular utility for people with Bipolar Affective Disorder (bipolar) due to the pattern of rapid loss and then recovery of DMC-T during episodes of illness. Furthermore, ADM is recommended by clinical experts in bipolar. However, the empirical evidence base for ADM in bipolar is unclear. Therefore, a systematic review is required to collate available evidence and define future research directions.MethodsA PRISMA concordant systematic review of empirical literature on the use of ADM in bipolar.ResultsWe found 13 eligible articles which reported on 11 studies. Of the eligible studies 2 used a mixed methods design, 8 were quantitative descriptive studies and 1 was a randomised controlled trial. Outcomes of included studies fell into 4 categories: Interest in ADM, type of ADM preferred, barriers to completing ADM and impact of ADM. The available evidence suggests that people with bipolar are interested in engaging with ADM which is supported, collaborative and allows them to state treatment requests and refusals.ConclusionsEvidence in this area is limited. Clinicians should be aware that service users with bipolar are likely to value their support in creating ADM documents. In addition, it seems that people with bipolar may face fewer barriers and achieve greater success with ADM compared to those with other severe mental illnesses. Given the greater focus and likely demand for ADM following upcoming legal reform, further research is urgently needed to ensure available resources are most effectively targeted to achieve the best outcomes from ADM activities. This research should focus on clarifying: causal assumptions around ADM, the outcomes which are valued by key stakeholders, barriers to achieving these outcomes, stakeholder opinions on supporting ‘self-binding’ and the development and evaluation of models of ADM which are tailored for fluctuating DMC-T.},

	abstract = {Federated learning can be a promising solution for enabling IoT cybersecurity (i.e., anomaly detection in the IoT environment) while preserving data privacy and mitigating the high communication/storage overhead (e.g., high-frequency data from time-series sensors) of centralized over-the-cloud approaches. In this paper, to further push forward this direction with a comprehensive study in both algorithm and system design, we build FedIoT platform that contains FedDetect algorithm for on-device anomaly data detection and a system design for realistic evaluation of federated learning on IoT devices. Furthermore, the proposed FedDetect learning framework improves the performance by utilizing a local adaptive optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a cross-round learning rate scheduler. In a network of realistic IoT devices (Raspberry PI), we evaluate FedIoT platform and FedDetect algorithm in both model and system performance. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of federated learning in detecting a wider range of attack types occurred at multiple devices. The system efficiency analysis indicates that both end-to-end training time and memory cost are affordable and promising for resource-constrained IoT devices.

In the near future, it is foreseeable to have decentralized data ownership in the finance sector using federated learning. This is a just-in-time technology that can learn intelligent models in a decentralized training manner. The most attractive aspect of federated learning is its ability to decompose model training into a centralized server and distributed nodes without collecting private data. This kind of decomposed learning framework has great potential to protect users' privacy and sensitive data. Therefore, federated learning combines naturally with an open banking data marketplaces.

	abstract = {Aims
To investigate trajectories of negative symptoms during the first 12months of treatment for first episode psychosis (FEP), their predictors and relationship to social recovery.
Method
1006 participants were followed up for 12months following acceptance into Early Intervention in Psychosis services. Negative symptom trajectories were modelled using latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and predictors of trajectories examined using multinomial regression. Social recovery trajectories – also modelled using LCGA – of members of each negative symptom trajectory were ascertained and the relationship between negative symptom and social recovery trajectories examined.
Results
Four negative symptom trajectories were identified: Minimal Decreasing (63.9\%), Mild Stable (13.5\%), High Decreasing (17.1\%) and High Stable (5.4\%). Male gender and family history of non-affective psychosis predicted stably high negative symptoms. Poor premorbid adolescent adjustment, family history of non-affective psychosis and baseline depression predicted initially high but decreasing negative symptoms. Members of the Mild Stable, High Stable and High Decreasing classes were more likely to experience stably low functioning than the Minimal Decreasing class.
Conclusions
Distinct negative symptom trajectories are evident in FEP. Only a small subgroup present with persistently high levels of negative symptoms. A substantial proportion of FEP patients with elevated negative symptoms at baseline will achieve remission of these symptoms within 12months. However, elevated negative symptoms at baseline, whether or not they remit, are associated with poor social recovery, suggesting targeted interventions for service users with elevated baseline negative symptoms may help improve functional outcomes.},

It is argued that this layering process is relatively irreversible, and that it operates simultaneously at a very concrete level (fields in a database) and at a very abstract one (the coding of the relationship between the disciplines and the production of a general ontology). Finally, it is maintained that science studies as a discipline is able to (and should) make a significant contribution to the design of robust and flexible databases which recognize this performative character of infrastructure.},

However, studies often rely on data stored in a centralized repository, where analysis is done with full access to the sensitive underlying content. Recent advances in federated learning enable building complex machine-learned models that are trained in a distributed fashion. These techniques facilitate the calculation of research study endpoints such that private data never leaves a given device or healthcare system. We show—on a diverse set of single and multi-site health studies—that federated models can achieve similar accuracy, precision, and generalizability, and lead to the same interpretation as standard centralized statistical models while achieving considerably stronger privacy protections and without significantly raising computational costs. This work is the first to apply modern and general federated learning methods that explicitly incorporate differential privacy to clinical and epidemiological research—across a spectrum of units of federation, model architectures, complexity of learning tasks and diseases. As a result, it enables health research participants to remain in control of their data and still contribute to advancing science—aspects that used to be at odds with each other.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood maltreatment is a well-known risk factor for developing a more severe and complex form of bipolar disorders (BD). However, knowledge is scarce about the interactions between childhood maltreatment and underlying genetic vulnerability on the clinical expression of BD.
METHOD: We assigned a BD-polygenic risk score (BD-PRS), calculated from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, to each individual in a sample of 402 cases with BD. The lifetime clinical expression of BD was characterized using structured interviews and patients completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to assess the severity of childhood maltreatment.
RESULTS: Cases who reported more severe childhood maltreatment had a lower BD-PRS (rho = -0.12, P = .01), especially when considering emotional abuse (rho = -0.16, P = .001). An interaction between BD-PRS and childhood maltreatment was observed for the risk of rapid cycling (P = .01). No further interactions between BD-PRS and childhood maltreatment were observed for other clinical characteristics (age at onset, suicide attempts, number of mood episodes, mixed features, substance use disorders and psychotic symptoms).
CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to show that less genetic risk may be needed to develop a more unstable form of BD when exposed to childhood maltreatment. Our study supports childhood trauma as an independent risk factor for BD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are frequently co-occurring and highly heritable mental health conditions. We hypothesized that BPD cases with an early age of onset (≤21 years old) would be particularly likely to show genetic covariation with ADHD.
METHODS: Genome-wide association study data were available for 4609 individuals with ADHD, 9650 individuals with BPD (5167 thereof with early-onset BPD), and 21,363 typically developing controls. We conducted a cross-disorder genome-wide association study meta-analysis to identify whether the observed comorbidity between ADHD and BPD could be due to shared genetic risks.
RESULTS: We found a significant single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlation between ADHD and BPD in the full and age-restricted samples (rGfull = .64, p = 3.13 × 10-14; rGrestricted = .71, p = 4.09 × 10-16). The meta-analysis between the full BPD sample identified two genome-wide significant (prs7089973 = 2.47 × 10-8; prs11756438 = 4.36 × 10-8) regions located on chromosomes 6 (CEP85L) and 10 (TAF9BP2). Restricting the analyses to BPD cases with an early onset yielded one genome-wide significant association (prs58502974 = 2.11 × 10-8) on chromosome 5 in the ADCY2 gene. Additional nominally significant regions identified contained known expression quantitative trait loci with putative functional consequences for NT5DC1, NT5DC2, and CACNB3 expression, whereas functional predictions implicated ABLIM1 as an allele-specific expressed gene in neuronal tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: The single nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic correlation between ADHD and BPD is substantial, significant, and consistent with the existence of genetic overlap between ADHD and BPD, with potential differential genetic mechanisms involved in early and later BPD onset.},

	abstract = {Algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have achieved significant progress in modeling word document relationships. These algorithms assume each word in the document was generated by a hidden topic and explicitly model the word distribution of each topic as well as the prior distribution over topics in the document. Given these parameters, the topics of all words in the same document are assumed to be independent. In this paper, we propose modeling the topics of words in the document as a Markov chain. Specifically, we assume that all words in the same sentence have the same topic, and successive sentences are more likely to have the same topics. Since the topics are hidden, this leads to using the well-known tools of Hidden Markov Models for learning and inference. We show that incorporating this dependency allows us to learn better topics and to disambiguate words that can belong to different topics. Quantitatively, we show that we obtain better perplexity in modeling documents with only a modest increase in learning and inference complexity.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Humor ratings are taken from the work of Engelthaler and Hills (2017) as well as from an original crowdsourcing study of 120,000 words.

We explored (1) catalysts for taking the screener, (2) anticipated outcomes, (3) reactions to the results, and (4) desired next steps. For many participants, the screener results validated their lived experiences of symptoms, but they were nevertheless unsure how to use the information to improve their mental health moving forward. Our findings suggest that online screeners can serve as a transition point in young people’s mental health journeys.

From this exploratory work, we delineate four directions for future HCI research into women's close relationships.},

But these tend to represent the psychological facet of mental states, which might not align with the physiological facet of that state. Our paper demonstrates that when what people “feel” differs from what people “say they feel”, we witness a semantic gap that limits predictions. We show that predicting mental wellbeing with passive data (offline sensors or online social media) is related to how the ground-truth is measured (objective arousal or self-report). Features with psycho-social signals (e.g., language) were better at predicting self-reported anxiety and stress. Conversely, features with behavioral signals (e.g., sleep), were better at predicting stressful arousal. Regardless of the source of ground truth, integrating both signals boosted prediction. To reduce the semantic gap, we provide recommendations to evaluate ground truth measures and adopt parsimonious sensing.},

Predicated on the use of existing personal devices rather than the introduction of additional instrumentation, smartphone-based digital phenotyping presents us with several opportunities and challenges in data collection and data analysis. These two aspects are strongly coupled, because decisions about what data to collect and how to collect it constrain what statistical analyses can be carried out, now and years later, and therefore ultimately determine what scientific, clinical, and public health questions may be asked and answered. Digital phenotyping combines the excitement of fast-paced technologies, smartphones, cloud computing and machine learning, with deep mathematical and statistical questions, and it does this in the service of a better understanding our own behavior in ways that are objective, scalable, and reproducible. We will discuss some fundamental aspects of collection and analysis of digital phenotyping data, which takes us on a brief tour of several important scientific and technological concepts, from the open-source paradigm to computational complexity, with some unexpected insights provided by fields as varied as zoology and quantum mechanics.},

This paper investigates the nature of digital phenotyping in relation to its alleged promise. Unlike most of the literature to date on philosophy and digital phenotyping, which has focused on its ethical aspects, this paper focuses on its epistemic and methodological aspects. The paper advances a tetra-taxonomy involving four scenario types in which knowledge may be acquired from human “digitypes” by digital phenotyping. These scenarios comprise two causal relations and a correlative and constitutive relation that can exist between information generated by digital systems/devices on the one hand and psychological or behavioral phenomena on the other. The paper describes several modes of inference involved in deriving knowledge within these scenarios. After this epistemic mapping, the paper analyzes the possible knowledge potential and limitations of digital phenotyping. It finds that digital phenotyping holds promise of delivering insight into conditions and states as well producing potentially new psychological categories. It also argues that care must be taken that digital phenotyping does not make unwarranted conclusions and is aware of potentially distorting effects in digital sensing and measurement. If digital phenotyping is to truly revolutionize knowledge of human life, it must deliver on a range of fronts, including making accurate forecasts and diagnoses of states and behaviors, providing causal explanations of these phenomena, and revealing important constituents of human conditions, psychology, and experience.},

However, we have little understanding of ways to leverage intergenerational communication between elderly parents and adult children to improve family health and the roles technology plays in supporting this process. In this study, we examine how intergenerational family relationships and technology use influence health communication and collaboration among family members, from which we identify design opportunities to promote a culture of health within the family. We conducted 10 focus group interviews with independent living elderly parents (n = 12) and adult children (n = 25). We present different types of health information sharing and motivations to curate what health-related information to be shared. We also explore how family members deal with obstacles in health information sharing. Based on our findings, we suggest design implications to promote effective sharing, to support different types of sharing, and to enhance family sharing to build a culture of health within the family.},

	abstract = {Communities and social networks play a signiﬁcant role in providing care and support for people who have experienced trauma. Increasing use of digital and networked technologies in people’s everyday lives present opportunities for connecting, communicating, interacting, and caring for one another in new ways, as evidenced in the recent emergence of technologies that are designed to support the post-trauma journey. At the same time, there are distinct shortcomings among the existing technologies in eﬀectively responding to the diverse and changing needs and desires of individuals, including meaningful engagement of trusted others, such as friends and family outside the therapy environment. After examining 83 existing design interventions that provide trauma-related support, this paper identiﬁes six broad themes evident in their approaches: symbolic engagements, creative oﬀerings of comfort and encouragements of self-care, the creative sharing of stories, online communities and agony aunts, the digitisation and re-design of psychology intervention, biometrics and data-driven. It further interrogates related opportunities and challenges to deliberate on how interventions might be designed with and for care at the intersection of communities and technologies, with a focus on engaging trusted others who in various ways and degrees, have a substantial impact on the post-trauma journey beyond therapy.},

	abstract = {Care pervades all interactions between people. Therefore, research that engages with human participants necessarily includes care, both from researchers and participants. These caring relationships are frequently left unaddressed in research reporting, disguising the fact that researchers are also cared for in their interactions with participants. In this paper, we demonstrate how a care ethics perspective helps to bring clarity to the care entanglements that pervade the relationships that develop between researchers and participants. This perspective not only leads to a more complete ability to disclose the position of the researcher in their data, but also provides insights into how we describe the empathic character of these relationships. We analyze the researcher–participant relationships we developed during two separate long-term research engagements—a 19-month ethnography and a 6-month design deployment—using a care ethics perspective. We discuss how researchers and participants navigate a complex set of roles and reflexively engage with interpersonal vulnerabilities and needs for care. We argue that researchers, particularly those who participate in long-term qualitative studies, have to engage authentically with the multiple subject positions they themselves occupy, as well as the multiple subject positions in which their research participants become entangled. This importantly includes researchers’ positions as individuals with human and social needs who participate in reciprocal, caring relationships with their participants. We argue that HCI research can benefit from incorporating a care ethics perspective, particularly in adopting the goals of developing empathic relationships with participants, acknowledging the reflexivity of research and engaging in researcher self-disclosure.Research participants and researchers perform care for each other throughout the research process.This is demonstrated through two long-term research engagements and a care ethics analysis of the relationships that developed between researchers and participants within them.This care ethics perspective enables a more complete form of researcher self-disclosure, and is helpful when attempting to develop an understanding of empathic relationships with participants.},

From these, we argue that tensions in care may not always be designed against, but can also be desired and generative. We conclude by discussing a ”wickedness” in caring for loved ones that problematizes in-home technologies as attractively naughty and potentially violent, and the four orientations as resources for interaction designers to spatially navigate tensions of domestic care.},

Managing diabetes with Nightscout is a deeply relational and (at times) contested activity for parent-caregivers, whose practices reveal the tensions and vulnerabilities of caregiving work enacted through data. As engagement with personal data becomes an increasingly powerful way people experience life, our findings call for alternative data narratives that reflect a multiplicity of emotional concerns and social arrangements.

To examine opportunities for family-centered health informatics, we interviewed 14 typically healthy families, interviewed 10 families with a child with a chronic condition, and conducted three participatory design sessions with children aged 7 to 11. Although we identified similarities between family-centered tracking and personal self-tracking, we also found families want to: (1) identify ripple effects between family members; (2) consider both caregivers and children as trackers to support distributing the burdens of tracking across family members; and (3) identify and pursue health guidelines that consider the state of their family (e.g., specific health guidelines for families that include a child with a chronic condition). We contribute to expanding the design lens from self-tracking to family-centered health tracking.},

FMCT is a tracking tool designed specifically for family caregivers to record their caregiving activities and patient's conditions. Our findings demonstrate how caregivers used it to better understand the illness and cope with depressed family members.

Most studies focused on improving the health of individuals, often neglecting factors at the community and society levels that influence health disparities. Moreover, few improvements in health outcomes were demonstrated. We further discuss factors that acted as barriers and facilitators of mHealth intervention adoption.

	abstract = {Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic condition with a high relapse rate, morbidity and psychosocial impairment that often persist despite pharmacotherapy, highlighting the need for adjunctive psychosocial treatments. It is still unclear which populations are most likely to beneﬁt from which approach and the best timing to implement them.
Methods: A review was conducted with the aim to determine what the efﬁcacious psychological treatments are, for whom and when. Randomized-controlled trials and key studies in adults with BD published until June 2013 were included
Results: The adjunctive psychological treatments most commonly tested in BD were cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, and family intervention. The efﬁcacy of speciﬁc adjunctive psychosocial interventions has been proven not only in short- but also long-term follow-up for some treatments. Outcomes vary between studies, with most trials focused on clinical variables like recurrence prevention or symptom reduction and less attention, although gradually expanding, paid to other aspects such as psychosocial functioning. The samples were usually in remission or with mild symptoms when recruited but there were a few studies with acute patients, which resulted in discrepant ﬁndings. The efﬁcacy of psychological interventions seems to differ depending on the characteristics of the subjects and the course of the illness. Different approaches, such as functional remediation and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, have begun to be tested in BD. Limitations: Heterogeneity of comparison groups.
Conclusions: Adjunctive psychological treatments can improve BD outcomes. Although several moderators and mediators have been identiﬁed, more research is needed to design shorter but effective interventions tailored to the characteristics of the target population. Ideally, the treatment should be introduced as soon as possible, although it does not mean that more complex patients would not beneﬁt from psychotherapy.},

A variety of technologies are available to support health information sharing (e.g., phone, video chat, social media), yet we still do not have a detailed understanding of which technologies are preferred and what challenges people still face when sharing information with them. To explore this, we conducted a mixed-method study—involving a survey and in-depth interviews—with people about their health information sharing routines and preferences for different technologies. Regardless of physical distance between distributed family members, synchronous methods of communication afforded the opportunity to provide affective support while asynchronous methods of communication were deemed to be the least intrusive. With family members adopting certain roles during the treatment of chronic illnesses, our findings suggest the need to design tools that mediate sharing health information across distance and age gaps, with consideration to respecting patient privacy while sharing health information.},

To help explain these cycles, we draw from Psychology to introduce the concept of rumination—anxious, perseverative cognition focused on negative aspects of the self—as a result of engaging with personal data. Rumination is an important concept for the Human Computer Interaction community because it can negatively affect users’ well-being and lead to maladaptive use. Thus, preventing and mitigating rumination is beneficial. In this conceptual paper, we differentiate reflection from rumination. We also explain how self-tracking technologies may inadvertently lead to rumination and the implications this has for design. Our goal is to expand self-tracking research by discussing these negative cycles and encourage researchers to consider rumination when studying, designing, and promoting tools to prevent adverse unintended consequences among users.},

This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and random forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

	abstract = {This literature review examines cross-disciplinary work on radicalization to situate, historicize, frame, and better understand the present concerns around online radicalization and far-right extremist and fringe movements. We find that research on radicalization is inextricably linked to the post-9/11 context in which it emerged, and as a result is overly focused on studying the other. Applying this research to the spread of far-right ideas online does not account for the ways in which the far-right’s endorsement of white supremacy and racism holds historical, normative precedent in the United States. Further, radicalization research is rife with uncertainties, ranging from definitional ambiguity to an inability to identify any simplistic, causal models capable of fully explaining the conditions under which radicalization occurs. Instead, there are multiple possible pathways to radicalization, and while the internet does not cause individuals to adopt far-right extremist or fringe beliefs, some technological affordances may aid adoption of these beliefs through gradual processes of socialization. We conclude that the term “radicalization” does not serve as a useful analytical frame for studying the spread of far-right and fringe ideas online. Instead, potential analytical frameworks better suited to studying these phenomena include theories prominent in the study of online communities, conversion, mainstreaming, and sociotechnical theories of media effects.},

Given its diﬀerences with physical illnesses, is it right to count it, and particular mental illnesses, as genuinely medical as opposed to moral matters? One debate concerns its value-ladenness, which has been used by anti-psychiatrists to argue that it does not exist. Recent attempts to deﬁne mental illness divide both on the presence of values and on their consequences. Philosophers and psychiatrists have explored the nature of the general kinds that mental illnesses might comprise, inﬂuenced by psychiatric taxonomies such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, and the rise of a rival biological ‘meta-taxonomy’: the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). The assumption that the concept of mental illness has a culturally invariant core has also been questioned. This Element serves as a guide to these contested debates.},

	abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted mental health care delivery to digital platforms, videoconferencing, and other mobile communications. However, existing reviews of digital health interventions are narrow in scope and focus on a limited number of mental health conditions.
Objective: To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive systematic meta-review of the literature to assess the state of digital health interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions.
Methods: We searched MEDLINE for secondary literature published between 2010 and 2021 on the use, efficacy, and appropriateness of digital health interventions for the delivery of mental health care.
Results: Of the 3022 records identified, 466 proceeded to full-text review and 304 met the criteria for inclusion in this study. A majority (52\%) of research involved the treatment of substance use disorders, 29\% focused on mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders, and \&gt;5\% for each remaining mental health conditions. Synchronous and asynchronous communication, computerized therapy, and cognitive training appear to be effective but require further examination in understudied mental health conditions. Similarly, virtual reality, mobile apps, social media platforms, and web-based forums are novel technologies that have the potential to improve mental health but require higher quality evidence.
Conclusions: Digital health interventions offer promise in the treatment of mental health conditions. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health interventions provide a safer alternative to face-to-face treatment. However, further research on the applications of digital interventions in understudied mental health conditions is needed. Additionally, evidence is needed on the effectiveness and appropriateness of digital health tools for patients who are marginalized and may lack access to digital health interventions.},

Compared to depression and euthymia, switching and clustering abnormalities were found in manic and mixed states, mimicking symptoms like flight of ideas. Moreover, the neuropsychological results, as well as the fact that error count did not increase whereas phonological associations did, showed that impaired inhibition abilities and distractibility could not account for the results in patients with manic symptoms. Rather, semantic overactivation in patients with manic symptoms, including mixed depression, may compensate for trait-like deficient semantic retrieval/access found in euthymia.},

The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist.

	abstract = {Background The development of mobile computing technology has enabled the delivery of psychological interventions while people go about their everyday lives. The original visions of the potential of these “ecological momentary interventions” were presented over a decade ago, and the widespread adoption of smartphones in the intervening years has led to a variety of research studies exploring the feasibility of these aspirations. However, there is a dearth of research describing the different dimensions, characteristics, and features of these interventions, as constructed. Objective To provide an overview of the definitions given for “ecological momentary interventions” in the treatment of common mental health disorders, and describe the set of technological and interaction possibilities which have been used in the design of these interventions. Methods A systematic search identified relevant literature published between 2009 and 2020 in the PubMed, PsycInfo, and ACM Guide to the Computing Literature databases. Following screening, data were extracted from eligible articles using a standardized extraction worksheet. Selected articles were then thematically categorized. Results The search identified 583 articles of which 64 met the inclusion criteria. The interventions target a range of mental health problems, with diverse aims, intervention designs and evaluation approaches. The studies employed a variety of features for intervention delivery, but recent research is overwhelmingly comprised of studies based on smartphone apps (30 of 42 papers that described an intervention). Twenty two studies employed sensors for the collection of data in order to provide just-in-time support or predict psychological states. Conclusions With the shift towards smartphone apps, the vision for EMIs has begun to be realised. Recent years have seen increased exploration of the use of sensors and machine learning, but the role of humans in the delivery of EMI is also varied. The variety of capabilities exhibited by EMIs motivates development of a more precise vocabulary for capturing both automatic and human tailoring of these interventions.},

	doi = {10.2196/35591},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions have a great potential to alleviate mental illness and increase access to care. However, these technologies face significant challenges, especially in terms of user engagement and adoption. It has been suggested that this issue stems from a lack of user perspective in the development process; accordingly, several human-centered design approaches have been developed over the years to consider this important aspect. Yet, few human-centered design approaches to digital solutions exist in the field of mental health, and rarely are end users involved in their development.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this literature review is to understand how human-centered design is considered in e-mental health intervention research.
METHODS: An exploratory mapping review was conducted of mental health journals with the explicit scope of covering e-mental health technology. The human-centered design approaches reported and the core elements of design activity (ie, object, context, design process, and actors involved) were examined among the eligible studies.
RESULTS: A total of 30 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 22 mentioned using human-centered design approaches or specific design methods in the development of an e-mental health solution. Reported approaches were classified as participatory design (11/27, 41\%), codesign (6/27, 22\%), user-centered design (5/27, 19\%), or a specific design method (5/27, 19\%). Just over half (15/27, 56\%) of the approaches mentioned were supported by references. End users were involved in each study to some extent but not necessarily in designing. About 27\% (8/30) of all the included studies explicitly mentioned the presence of designers on their team.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that some attempts have indeed been made to integrate human-centered design approaches into digital mental health technology development. However, these attempts rely very little on designers and design research. Researchers from other domains and technology developers would be wise to learn the underpinnings of human-centered design methods before selecting one over another. Inviting designers for assistance when implementing a particular approach would also be beneficial. To further motivate interest in and use of human-centered design principles in the world of e-mental health, we make nine suggestions for better reporting of human-centered design approaches in future research.},

The recent proliferation of mobile technology has allowed for investigation into psychological phenomena in participants’ daily lives, clarifying many momentary and prospective relationships. Studying impulsivity using daily life methods offers promise in understanding impulsive processes and proximal influences on behavior. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify studies assessing impulsivity in daily life to characterize the conceptualization, measurement, and validity of momentary impulsivity. The studies reviewed highlight the reliability and validity of the construct of momentary impulsivity and identify areas for improvement in measurement and statistical practices. We make suggestions for future research based on the evidence presented.},

	abstract = {Background: Compulsive buying behavior (CBB) is receiving increasing consideration in both consumer and psychiatric-epidemiological research, yet empirical evidence on treatment interventions is scarce and mostly from small homogeneous clinical samples.
Objectives: To estimate the short-term effectiveness of a standardized, individual cognitive behavioral therapy intervention (CBT) in a sample of n = 97 treatment-seeking patients diagnosed with CBB, and to identify the most relevant predictors of therapy outcome.
Method: The intervention consisted of 12 individual CBT weekly sessions, lasting approximately 45 minutes each. Data on patients’ personality traits, psychopathology, sociodemographic factors, and compulsive buying behavior were used in our analysis.
Results: The risk (cumulative incidence) of poor adherence to the CBT program was 27.8\%. The presence of relapses during the CBT program was 47.4\% and the dropout rate was 46.4\%. Signiﬁcant predictors of poor therapy adherence were being male, high levels of depression and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, low anxiety levels, high persistence, high harm avoidance and low self-transcendence.
Conclusion: Cognitive behavioral models show promise in treating CBB, however future interventions for CBB should be designed via a multidimensional approach in which patients’ sex, comorbid symptom levels and the personality-trait proﬁles play a central role.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.6645},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital mental health tools have tended to use psychoeducational strategies based on treatment orientations developed and validated outside of digital health. These features do not map well to the brief but frequent ways that people use mobile phones and mobile phone apps today. To address these challenges, we developed a suite of apps for depression and anxiety called IntelliCare, each developed with a focused goal and interactional style. IntelliCare apps prioritize interactive skills training over education and are designed for frequent but short interactions.
OBJECTIVE: The overall objective of this study was to pilot a coach-assisted version of IntelliCare and evaluate its use and efficacy at reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.
METHODS: Participants, recruited through a health care system, Web-based and community advertising, and clinical research registries, were included in this single-arm trial if they had elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety. Participants had access to the 14 IntelliCare apps from Google Play and received 8 weeks of coaching on the use of IntelliCare. Coaching included an initial phone call plus 2 or more texts per week over the 8 weeks, with some participants receiving an additional brief phone call. Primary outcomes included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety. Participants were compensated up to US \$90 for completing all assessments; compensation was not for app use or treatment engagement.
RESULTS: Of the 99 participants who initiated treatment, 90.1\% (90/99) completed 8 weeks. Participants showed substantial reductions in the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (P{\textless}.001). Participants used the apps an average of 195.4 (SD 141) times over the 8 weeks. The average length of use was 1.1 (SD 2.1) minutes, and 95\% of participants downloaded 5 or more of the IntelliCare apps.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the IntelliCare framework of providing a suite of skills-focused apps that can be used frequently and briefly to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. The IntelliCare system is elemental, allowing individual apps to be used or not used based on their effectiveness and utility, and it is eclectic, viewing treatment strategies as elements that can be applied as needed rather than adhering to a singular, overarching, theoretical model.

	abstract = {The National Institute of Mental Health launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative to better understand dimensions of behavior and identify targets for treatment. Examining dimensions across psychiatric illnesses has proven challenging, as reliable behavioral paradigms that are known to engage specific neural circuits and translate across diagnostic populations are scarce. Delay discounting paradigms seem to be an exception: they are useful for understanding links between neural systems and behavior in healthy individuals, with potential for assessing how these mechanisms go awry in psychiatric illnesses. This article reviews relevant literature on delay discounting (or the rate at which the value of a reward decreases as the delay to receipt increases) in humans, including methods for examining it, its putative neural mechanisms, and its application in psychiatric research. There exist rigorous and reproducible paradigms to evaluate delay discounting, standard methods for calculating discount rate, and known neural systems probed by these paradigms. Abnormalities in discounting have been associated with psychopathology ranging from addiction (with steep discount rates indicating relative preference for immediate rewards) to anorexia nervosa (with shallow discount rates indicating preference for future rewards). The latest research suggests that delay discounting can be manipulated in the laboratory. Extensively studied in cognitive neuroscience, delay discounting assesses a dimension of behavior that is important for decision-making and is linked to neural substrates and to psychopathology. The question now is whether manipulating delay discounting can yield clinically significant changes in behavior that promote health. If so, then delay discounting could deliver on the RDoC promise.},

	abstract = {In December 2019, the Digital Health Care Act (“Digitale-Versorgung-Gesetz”) introduced a general entitlement to the provision and reimbursement of digital health applications (DiGA) for insured persons in the German statutory health insurance. As establishing a new digital service area within the solidarity-based insurance system implies several administrative and regulatory challenges, this paper aims to describe the legal framework for DiGA market access and pricing as well as the status quo of the DiGA market. Furthermore, we provide a basic approach to deriving valuebased DiGA prices. To become eligible for reimbursement, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices evaluates the compliance of a DiGA with general requirements (e.g., safety and data protection) and its positive healthcare effects (i.e., medical benefit or improvements of care structure and processes) in a fast-track process. Manufacturers may provide evidence for the benefits of their DiGA either directly with the application for the fast-track process or generate it during a trial phase that includes temporary reimbursement. After one year of reimbursement, the freely-set manufacturer price is replaced by a price negotiated between the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds and the manufacturer. By February 2022, 30 DiGA had successfully completed the fast-track process. 73\% make use of the trial phase and have not yet proven their benefit. Given this dynamic growth of the DiGA market and the low minimum evidence standards, fair pricing remains the central point of contention. The regulatory framework makes the patientrelevant benefits of a DiGA a pricing criterion to be considered in particular. Yet, it does not indicate how the benefits of a DiGA should be translated into a reasonable price. Our evidence-based approach to value-based DiGA pricing approximates the SHI’s willingness to pay by the average cost-effectiveness of one or more established therapy in a field of indication and furthermore considers the positive healthcare effects of a DiGA. The proposed approach can be fitted into DiGA pricing processes under the given regulatory framework and can provide objective guidance for price negotiations. However, it is only one piece of the pricing puzzle, and numerous methodological and procedural issues related to DiGA pricing are still open. Thus, it remains to be seen to what extent DiGA prices will follow the premise of value-based pricing.},

Method: Subjects were 129 offspring of 80 bipolar parents and their spouses and 1122 young adults from the general population. In offspring the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV was used to assess DSM-IV diagnoses and the EMBU was used to assess perceived parental rearing in both groups. Results: In general, offspring growing up in a family with a bipolar parent perceived their mothers as less rejecting, more emotionally warm and less overprotecting and their fathers as less emotionally warm and less overprotecting compared with young adults from the general population. Perceived rejection was related to psychopathology in offspring. Conclusion: Overall, parental rearing in families with a parent with a bipolar disorder is not more dysfunctional, as perceived by their offspring, than in families from the general population. Offspring with a bipolar disorder perceive their parents as more rejecting.},

With the influx of digital mental health services changing the way mental health care is delivered, peer supporters are increasingly using technology to deliver peer support. In light of these technological advances, there is a need to review and synthesize the emergent evidence for peer-supported digital health interventions for adults with mental health conditions.
Objective: The aim of this study was to identify and review the evidence of digital peer support interventions for people with a lived experience of a serious mental illness.
Methods: This systematic review was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) procedures. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between 1946 and December 2018 that examined digital peer support interventions for people with a lived experience of a serious mental illness.  Additional articles were found by searching the reference lists from the 27 articles that met the inclusion criteria and a Google Scholar search in June 2019. Participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) criteria were used to assess study eligibility. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and reviewed all full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Methodological Quality Rating Scale.
Results: A total of 30 studies (11 randomized controlled trials, 2 quasiexperimental, 15 pre-post designs, and 2 qualitative studies) were included that reported on 24 interventions. Most of the studies demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of peer-to-peer networks, peer-delivered interventions supported with technology, and use of asynchronous and synchronous technologies.
Conclusions: Digital peer support interventions appear to be feasible and acceptable, with strong potential for clinical effectiveness. However, the field is in the early stages of development and requires well-powered efficacy and clinical effectiveness trials.

	abstract = {Background: Peer support is an approach to cope with mental illness, and technology provides a way to facilitate peer support. However, there are barriers to seeking support in offline and technology-mediated contexts.
Objective: This study aims to uncover potential ways to design digital mental health peer support systems and to outline a set of principles for future designers to consider as they embark on designing these systems. By learning how existing systems are used by people in daily life and by centering their experiences, we can better understand how to design mental health peer support technologies that foreground people’s needs. One existing digital peer support system is Buddy Project, the case study in this paper.
Methods: This paper reports on an interview study with Buddy Project users (N=13). Data were analyzed using the constant comparative approach.
Results: Individuals matched through Buddy Project developed supportive friendships with one another, leading them to become each other’s peer supporters in their respective journeys. It was not only the mental health peer support that was important to participants but also being able to connect over other parts of their lives and identities. The design of Buddy Project provided a sense of anonymity and separation from pre-existing ties, making it easier for participants to disclose struggles; moreover, the pairs appreciated being able to browse each other’s social media pages before connecting. Buddy Project has an explicit mission to prevent suicide and demonstrates this mission across its online platforms, which helps reduce the stigma around mental health within the peer support space. Pairs were matched based on shared interests and identities. This choice aided the pairs in developing meaningful, compatible, and supportive relationships with each other, where they felt seen and understood. However, the pairs were concerned that matching based on a shared mental health diagnosis may lead to sharing unhealthy coping mechanisms or comparing themselves and the severity of their experiences with their peers.
Conclusions: The results of this study shed light on desirable features of a digital mental health peer support system: matching peers based on interests and identities that they self-identify with; having an explicit mental health–related mission coupled with social media and other web-based presences to signal that discussing mental health is safe within the peer support ecosystem; and not matching peers based on a broad mental health diagnosis. However, if the diagnosis is important, this matching should account for illness severity and educate peers on how to provide support while avoiding suggesting unhelpful coping mechanisms; allowing for some degree of anonymity and control over how peers present themselves to each other; and providing relevant information and tools to potential peers to help them decide if they would like to embark on a relationship with their matched peer before connecting with them.

Limited research has investigated the everyday practices of self-tracking for BD, and it is unclear how the normative ontology that is seen in existing self-tracking technology discourses (e.g. the Quantifed Self movement) is applicable to the domain of mental health. Combining principles of Patient and Public Involvement (PPI)—a staple research design principle in mental healthcare—with design and HCI-oriented research approaches, we conducted interviews and workshops with people with lived experience of BD to explore reasons and methods for self-tracking, and challenges and opportunities for technology. Our results describe recommendations for the design of self-tracking mental health technology. We also refect upon the complex role of researchers working at the intersection of emerging mental health technologies, the principles of PPI, and HCI research.},

Conversely, from Study 2 we find that online impulse buyers want tools that (a) encourage deliberation and avoidance, (b) enforce spending limits and postponement, (c) increase checkout effort, (d) make costs more salient, and (e) reduce product desire.

	abstract = {Impulse buying is a common but potentially problematic behavior that can leave
consumers with financial hardship and feelings of regret. The goal of this dissertation is
to understand how to support consumers who wish to gain greater control of their online
impulse buying. This research first investigates how current e-commerce stores
encourage impulsive spending by conducting a content analysis of 200 top-earning
shopping websites (Study 1). We demonstrate that the use of impulse-driving features is
common and we catalog the different types of features that are commonly used.
Second, we take a user-centered approach by directly asking consumers what type of
support they would like in tackling online impulse buying (Study 2). A survey of 151
frequent online impulse buyers reveals that consumers want tools that, for example,
make costs more salient, encourage reflection, enforce spending limits, increase
checkout effort, and postpone purchases. Consumers were not interested in social
accountability tools or tools utilizing regret or guilt.
Relying on these insights, we designed and tested postponement, reflection, and
distraction interventions to encourage self-control with e-commerce (Studies 3-5).
Through an online experiment, we show that a 25-hour delay is effective at lowering
consumer’s felt urge to buy impulsively and also at lowering purchase intent (Study 3).
Conversely, an in-lab experiment testing a 10-minute delay on Amazon purchases failed
to show a statistically significant decline in the number of impulse products purchased
or dollars spent impulsively (Study 4). We highlight that 100\% of participants continued
to shop during their 10-minute delay to help explain the lack of an effect. Finally,
through an online experiment, we show that prompting consumers to spend
approximately 3 ½ minutes listing reasons for and against buying a product or engaging
in a distracting task reduces the felt urge to buy impulsively and purchase intent. We
conclude by asserting that postponement is an effective self-control strategy if (a) the 
xvi
delay is long enough to allow for the natural distractions of life to cool the impulse to buy
or (b) is short but focused on either reflecting on the product or focused on something
distracting, but not focused on browsing for additional impulse purchases. Taken
together, this dissertation takes a consumer advocacy perspective by shedding light on
potentially problematic design practices, by identifying opportunities for corporations to
engage in more transparent design, and by providing design recommendations for
technologies that help consumers achieve greater self-control with e-commerce.},

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with increased risk of detrimental life outcomes. Recent research also indicates that ADHD is associated with sexual risk behavior, such as unprotected sex. Some risky sexual behaviors may be driven, in part, by preference for immediate rewards, referred to as delay discounting, which is prominent in etiological models of ADHD. Therefore, the present study examined the effect of delay on preference for both monetary and sexual outcomes in adults with many ADHD symptoms (both on and off medication) and with fewer ADHD symptoms. Online participants (N = 275; n = 161 males, n = 114 females) completed a monetary delay discounting task, assessing preference for smaller sooner versus larger delayed hypothetical money, and the Sexual Delay Discounting Task, assessing preference for condom use in hypothetical casual sex scenarios based on delay until condom availability. Those with greater ADHD symptoms discounted delayed monetary outcomes as well as delayed condom-protected sex (i.e., preferred sooner money rewards and immediate unprotected sex) significantly more than those with fewer symptoms; however, no effect of current medication use was found across monetary or sexual delay discounting among those with greater ADHD symptoms. This study is the first to demonstrate the relation between ADHD symptoms and reduced condom-use likelihood. Increased discounting of delayed condom-protected sex might constitute one mechanism of risky sexual behavior among individuals with ADHD symptoms. Interventions geared toward increasing condom use in situations in which condoms may otherwise be unavailable, may mitigate risky sexual behaviors and their associated harms in this population.},

	abstract = {In everyday decision-making, individuals make trade-offs between short-term and long-term benefits or costs. Depending on many factors, individuals may choose to wait for larger delayed reward, yet in other situations they may prefer the smaller, immediate reward. In addition to within-subject variation in the short-term versus long-term reward trade-off, there are also interindividual differences in delay discounting (DD), which have been shown to be quite stable. The extent to which individuals discount the value of delayed rewards turns out to be associated with important health and disorder-related outcomes: the more discounting, the more unhealthy or problematic choices. This has led to the hypothesis that DD can be conceptualized as trans-disease process. The current systematic review presents an overview of behavioral trainings and manipulations that have been developed to reduce DD in human participants aged 12 years or older. Manipulation studies mostly contain one session and measure DD directly after the manipulation. Training studies add a multiple session training component that is not per se related to DD, in between two DD task measurements. Ninety-eight studies (151 experiments) were identified that tested behavioral trainings and manipulations to decrease DD. Overall, results indicated that DD can be decreased, showing that DD is profoundly context dependent and changeable. Most promising avenues to pursue in future research seem to be acceptance-based/mindfulness-based trainings, and even more so manipulations involving a future orientation. Limitations and recommendations are discussed to identify the mechanistic processes that allow for changes in discount rate and behavior accordingly.},

Episodic future thinking (EFT) helps adults make healthier decisions by initiating prospective thinking, which guides one to forego smaller immediate rewards in favor of larger delayed rewards. EFT could help parents improve grocery purchases thereby improving the home food environment and family eating behaviors. The effect of EFT on food shopping was evaluated in two studies with mothers who were overweight/obese and primary household shoppers. In , 24 mothers were randomized to goal-directed process EFT versus a money saving control. In , 33 mothers were randomized to goal-directed process EFT, general EFT, or an episodic recent thinking (ERT) control. Following cue generation, participants completed a task where they purchased one week of groceries from an online store. Food purchases were analyzed for calories purchased per family member. In  the goal-directed process EFT group purchased fewer calories per person (F(1, 23) = 25.16, p {\textless} .001; ηp2 = .522). In  the goal-directed process EFT purchased fewer calories (F(1, 30) = 5.98, p = 0.02; ηp2 = .166) than the ERT control as did the EFT general group (F(1, 30) = 4.61, p = 0.04; ηp2 = .133). The two EFT groups did not differ from each other (F(1, 30) = 0.16, p = 0.69; ηp2 = .005). EFT may be an effective intervention when grocery shopping to reduce energy intake of foods purchased and could be a helpful component to a behavioral family-based obesity treatment program.},

We draw on decolonial thought and critiques of identity-based algorithmic bias to analyze the underlying power relations impacting digital mental health technologies today, and envision new pathways towards a decolonial digital mental health. We argue that a decolonial digital mental health is one that centers lived experience over rigid classifcation, is conscious of structural factors that infuence mental wellbeing, and is fundamentally designed to deter the creation of power diferentials that prevent people from having agency over their care. Stemming from this vision, we make recommendations for how researchers and designers can support more equitable futures for people experiencing mental distress and illness.},

	abstract = {High prevalence of mental illness and the need for effective mental health care, combined with recent advances in AI, has led to an increase in explorations of how the field of machine learning (ML) can assist in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. ML techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using ML within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective ML-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current ML work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and HCI literature. A quantitative synthesis and qualitative narrative review of 54 papers that were included in the analysis surfaced common trends, gaps, and challenges in this space. Discussing our findings, we (i) reflect on the current state-of-the-art of ML work for mental health, (ii) provide concrete suggestions for a stronger integration of human-centered and multi-disciplinary approaches in research and development, and (iii) invite more consideration of the potentially far-reaching personal, social, and ethical implications that ML models and interventions can have, if they are to find widespread, successful adoption in real-world mental health contexts.},

	abstract = {Affirmative consent is the idea that someone must ask for, and earn, enthusiastic approval before interacting with someone else. For decades, feminist activists and scholars have used affirmative consent to theorize and prevent sexual assault. In this paper, we ask: Can affirmative consent help to theorize online interaction? Drawing from feminist, legal, and HCI literature, we introduce the feminist theory of affirmative consent and use it to analyze social computing systems. We present affirmative consent’s five core concepts: it is voluntary, informed, revertible, specific, and unburdensome. Using these principles, this paper argues that affirmative consent is both an explanatory and generative theoretical framework. First, affirmative consent is a theoretical abstraction for explaining various problematic phenomena in social platforms—including mass online harassment, revenge porn, and problems with content feeds. Finally, we argue that affirmative consent is a generative theoretical foundation from which to imagine new design ideas for consentful socio-technical systems.},

	abstract = {Powered by machine learning techniques, social media provides an unobtrusive lens into individual behaviors, emotions, and psychological states. Recent research has successfully employed social media data to predict mental health states of individuals, ranging from the presence and severity of mental disorders like depression to the risk of suicide. These algorithmic inferences hold great potential in supporting early detection and treatment of mental disorders and in the design of interventions. At the same time, the outcomes of this research can pose great risks to individuals, such as issues of incorrect, opaque algorithmic predictions, involvement of bad or unaccountable actors, and potential biases from intentional or inadvertent misuse of insights. Amplifying these tensions, there are also divergent and sometimes inconsistent methodological gaps and under-explored ethics and privacy dimensions. This paper presents a taxonomy of these concerns and ethical challenges, drawing from existing literature, and poses questions to be resolved as this research gains traction. We identify three areas of tension: ethics committees and the gap of social media research; questions of validity, data, and machine learning; and implications of this research for key stakeholders. We conclude with calls to action to begin resolving these interdisciplinary dilemmas.},

	abstract = {This article explores the contribution of self-help/mutual aid groups to mental well-being. Self-help/mutual aid groups are self-organising groups where people come together to address a shared a health or social issue through mutual support. They are associated with a range of health and social benefits, but remain poorly understood. This article draws on data from stage one of ESTEEM, a project which runs from 2010 to 2013. Stage one ran from 2010 to 2011 and involved participatory, qualitative research carried out in two UK sites. Twenty-one groups were purposively selected to include a range of focal issues, longevity, structures and ethnic backgrounds. Researchers carried out 21 interviews with group coordinators and twenty group discussions with members to explore the groups' purpose, nature and development. Preliminary analysis of the data suggested that mental well-being was a common theme across the groups. Subsequently the data were re-analysed to explore the groups' contribution to mental well-being using a checklist of protective factors for mental well-being as a coding framework. The findings showed that groups made a strong contribution to members' mental well-being by enhancing a sense of control, increasing resilience and facilitating participation. Group members were uplifted by exchanging emotional and practical support; they gained self-esteem, knowledge and confidence, thereby increasing their control over their situation. For some groups, socio-economic factors limited their scope and threatened their future. The article provides an evidence-base which illustrates how self-help/mutual aid groups can enhance mental well-being. If supported within a strategy for social justice, these groups enable people with varied concerns to develop a tailored response to their specific needs. The authors suggest that policy-makers engage with local people, investing in support proportionate to the needs of different populations, enabling them to develop their own self-help/mutual aid groups to enhance their sense of mental well-being.},

Twenty-eight subjects were assigned to receive active treatment and 11 to the waiting list control group. The results at the end of treatment showed signiﬁcant advantages for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) over the waiting list in reductions in the number of compulsive buying episodes and time spent buying, as well as scores on the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale—Shopping Version and the Compulsive Buying Scale. Improvement was well-maintained at 6-month follow-up. The pilot data suggests that a cognitive behavioral intervention can be quite effective in the treatment of compulsive buying disorder.

ReMindCare is a smartphone app that has been systematically implemented in a first episode of psychosis program (FEPP) for patients with early psychosis since 2018.
Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of ReMindCare after 19 months of use in the clinic and varying use by individual patients.
Methods: The integration of the ReMindCare app into the FEPP started in October 2018. Patients with early psychosis self-selected to the app (ReMindCare group) or treatment as usual (TAU group). The outcome variables considered were adherence to the intervention and number of relapses, hospital admissions, and visits to urgent care units. Data from 90 patients with early psychosis were analyzed: 59 in the ReMindCare group and 31 in the TAU group. The mean age of the sample was 32.8 (SD 9.4) years, 73\% (66/90) were males, 91\% (83/90) were White, and 81\% (74/90) were single.
Results: Significant differences between the ReMindCare and TAU groups were found in the number of relapses, hospitalizations, and visits to urgent care units, with each showing benefits for the app. Only 20\% (12/59) of patients from the ReMindCare group had a relapse, while 58\% (18/31) of the TAU patients had one or more relapses (χ2=13.7, P=.001). Moreover, ReMindCare patients had fewer visits to urgent care units (χ2=7.4, P=.006) and fewer hospitalizations than TAU patients (χ2=4.6, P=.03). The mean of days using the app was 352.2 (SD 191.2; min/max: 18-594), and the mean of engagement was 84.5 (SD 16.04).
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first eHealth intervention that has preliminarily proven its benefits in the real-world treatment of patients with early psychosis.},

There has been no review of self-stigma frequency and correlates in different cultural and geographic areas and SMI. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to review the frequency, correlates, and consequences of self-stigma in individuals with SMI; (2) to compare self-stigma in different geographical areas and to review its potential association with cultural factors; (3) to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the current body of evidence to guide future research. A systematic electronic database search (PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Ovid SP Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL]) following PRISMA guidelines, was conducted on the frequency, correlates, and consequences of self-stigma in SMI. Out of 272 articles, 80 (29.4\%) reported on the frequency of self-stigma (n = 25 458), 241 (88.6\%) on cross-sectional correlates of self-stigma and 41 (15.0\%) on the longitudinal correlates and consequences of self-stigma. On average, 31.3\% of SMI patients reported high self-stigma. The highest frequency was in South-East Asia (39.7\%) and the Middle East (39\%). Sociodemographic and illness-related predictors yielded mixed results. Perceived and experienced stigma—including from mental health providers—predicted self-stigma, which supports the need to develop anti-stigma campaigns and recovery-oriented practices. Increased transition to psychosis and poor clinical and functional outcomes are both associated with self-stigma. Psychiatric rehabilitation and recovery-oriented early interventions could reduce self-stigma and should be better integrated into public policy.},

Interventions to improve help-seeking have been developed, but their effectiveness is unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis were therefore conducted to examine the effectiveness of mental health related help-seeking interventions. Nine databases in English, German and Chinese were searched for randomised and non-randomised controlled trials. Effect sizes were calculated for attitudes, intentions and behaviours to seek formal, informal and self-help. Ninety-eight studies with 69 208 participants were included. Interventions yielded significant short-term benefits in terms of formal help-seeking, self-help, as well as mental health literacy and personal stigma. There were also positive long-term effects on formal help-seeking behaviours. The most common intervention types were strategies to increase mental health literacy, destigmatisation (both had positive short-term effects on formal help-seeking behaviours) as well as motivational enhancement (with positive long-term effects on formal help-seeking behaviours). Interventions improved formal help-seeking behaviours if delivered to people with or at risk of mental health problems, but not among children, adolescents or the general public. There was no evidence that interventions increased the use of informal help. Few studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study provides evidence for the effectiveness of help-seeking interventions in terms of improving attitudes, intentions and behaviours to seek formal help for mental health problems among adults. Future research should develop effective interventions to improve informal help-seeking, for specific target groups and in LMICs settings.},

	abstract = {Background:Despite the high prevalence of mental health disorders worldwide, a significant proportion of distressed individuals do not seek professional help. Digital technology can be a potential bridge to reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders. A systematic review was undertaken to examine the technology-based interventions aimed at improving help-seeking attitude, intention, or behavior for mental health concerns.Methods:The literature search was conducted in January?February 2020 through various e-databases using relevant keywords that targeted help-seeking interventions for mental health disorders via different technology modes.Results:21 studies (15 randomized controlled trials and six non-randomized studies) were reviewed. The included studies were published between April 2006 to February 2020. Majority of the interventions led to an increase in the help-seeking variables. The crucial role of online delivery, participant involvement, and embedded links to professional services in encouraging help-seeking is highlighted. The review emphasizes the need for understanding utility of multicomponent interventions with personalized elements targeting help-seeking behavior, particularly in low-middle-income countries, and studies involving longer duration follow-ups.Conclusion:This systematic review is the first of its kind to examine technology-based interventions to improve help-seeking for mental health and suggests that such interventions play a crucial role in positively impacting help-seeking. The complex interplay between the relevant variables such as mental health literacy, stigma, help-seeking attitude, intention and behavior, and the intervention components that may have a differential bearing on these variables are issues that merit urgent attention in further research.},

	abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates integration of dopamine function with metabolic signals, highlighting a potential role for dopamine in energy balance, frequently construed as modulating reward in response to homeostatic state. Though its precise role remains controversial, the reward perspective of dopamine has dominated investigation of motivational disorders, including obesity. In the hypothesis outlined here, we suggest instead that the primary role of dopamine in behavior is to modulate activity to adapt behavioral energy expenditure to the prevailing environmental energy conditions, with the role of dopamine in reward and motivated behaviors derived from its primary role in energy balance. Dopamine has long been known to modulate activity, exemplified by psychostimulants that act via dopamine. More recently, there has been nascent investigation into the role of dopamine in modulating voluntary activity, with some investigators suggesting that dopamine may serve as a final common pathway that couples energy sensing to regulated voluntary energy expenditure. We suggest that interposed between input from both the internal and external world, dopamine modulates behavioral energy expenditure along two axes: a conserve-expend axis that regulates generalized activity and an explore-exploit axes that regulates the degree to which reward value biases the distribution of activity. In this view, increased dopamine does not promote consumption of tasty food. Instead increased dopamine promotes energy expenditure and exploration while decreased dopamine favors energy conservation and exploitation. This hypothesis provides a mechanistic interpretation to an apparent paradox: the well-established role of dopamine in food seeking and the findings that low dopaminergic functions are associated with obesity. Our hypothesis provides an alternative perspective on the role of dopamine in obesity and reinterprets the “reward deficiency hypothesis” as a perceived energy deficit. We propose that dopamine, by facilitating energy expenditure, should be protective against obesity. We suggest the apparent failure of this protective mechanism in Western societies with high prevalence of obesity arises as a consequence of sedentary lifestyles that thwart energy expenditure.},

Taking a quick look around me, I see computing systems in literally everything—in the cars, televisions, smartphones, restaurants, ski-lifts, heating systems, sports trackers, medical devices, etc. This has been realized by a tremendous development in hardware and software technology in terms of CPUs, memory, sensors, operating systems, network, display, etc. However, looking back at this technology development—and the research done in the field—it strikes me that something is missing. One of the grand visions was to make the computer “invisible,” as framed by Weiser. But it seems like instead of computing becoming more invisible, it is taking up more of the user’s attention. In this article, I argue that this is because (pervasive) computing has only come halfway. Much effort has been done in terms of sensing and understanding the world around the user, while much less effort has been put into helping the user actually doing anything. By providing examples mostly taken from the medical domain, this article discusses if moving from “sensing” and “thinking” to actually “doing” something is possible and what challenges are associated with this movement.},

The concept of digital phenotyping is based on the idea that collecting real-time markers of human behavior allows us to determine the digital signature of a pathology. This strategy assumes that behaviors are quantifiable from data extracted and analyzed through digital sensors, wearable devices, or smartphones. That concept could bring a shift in the diagnosis of mood disorders, introducing for the first time additional examinations on psychiatric routine care.ObjectiveThe main objective of this review was to propose a conceptual and critical review of the literature regarding the theoretical and technical principles of the digital phenotypes applied to mood disorders.MethodsWe conducted a review of the literature by updating a previous article and querying the PubMed database between February 2017 and November 2021 on titles with relevant keywords regarding digital phenotyping, mood disorders and artificial intelligence.ResultsOut of 884 articles included for evaluation, 45 articles were taken into account and classified by data source (multimodal, actigraphy, ECG, smartphone use, voice analysis, or body temperature). For depressive episodes, the main finding is a decrease in terms of functional and biological parameters [decrease in activities and walking, decrease in the number of calls and SMS messages, decrease in temperature and heart rate variability (HRV)], while the manic phase produces the reverse phenomenon (increase in activities, number of calls and HRV).ConclusionThe various studies presented support the potential interest in digital phenotyping to computerize the clinical characteristics of mood disorders.},

Several studies have specifically shown a high prevalence of comorbid mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder (BD), in those diagnosed with ADHD. Several common symptoms of ADHD are also found in BD, which are characterized by alternating periods of euthymia and mood disturbances. The inattention and impulsivity of ADHD can be seen in manic and hypomanic episodes of BD. Over the past decade, there has been an increased interest in research between the correlation of ADHD and pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) in children. Some experts hypothesize that more children are comorbidly diagnosed with ADHD and PBD because of how many clinicians treat children with ADHD. Other factors, which may affect the dual diagnoses of ADHD and PBD, are overlapping diagnostic criteria for the two disorders, the inevitable biases seen when one disorder is diagnosed without the other, and related risk factors leading to prodromal relationships. By examining clinical trials, a better understanding of whether ADHD and PBD have a stepwise progression or if other factors influence these comorbidities, such as blurred lines of diagnostic criteria. Those with ADHD are also at an increased risk of impairment at work and in social settings.

The results suggested that this questionnaire derives the two predicted factors (cognitively based credibility and relatively more a!ectively based expectancy) and that these factors are stable across di!erent populations. Furthermore, the questionnaire demonstrated high internal consistency within each factor and good test\vphantom{\{}\}retest reliability. The expectancy factor predicted outcome on some measures, whereas the credibility factor was unrelated to outcome. The questionnaire is appended to the paper, yet the authors stress care when utilizing the scale. During the administration of the questionnaire, the participant sees two sections * one related to thinking and one related to feeling. However, the researcher needs to be aware that the 2 factors derived are not grouped into those questions. Instead credibility was found to be derived from the "rst three think questions and expectancy was derived from the fourth think question and the two feel questions. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Our analysis and review is conducted explicitly from an insider perspective, bringing our perspectives as neurodivergent researchers to the topic of technologies in the context of ADHD. We found that 1) technologies are largely used to ‘mitigate’ the experiences of ADHD which are perceived as disruptive to neurotypical standards of behaviour; 2) little HCI research in the area invites this population to co-construct the technologies or to leverage neurodivergent experiences in the construction of research aims; and 3) participant resistance to deficit frames can be read within the researchers’ own accounts of participant actions. We discuss the implications of this status quo for disabled people and technology researchers alike, and close with a set of recommendations for future work in this area.},

Objective  To compare differences in adverse childhood experiences among those with different mental disorders and their relationships in a cross-­disorder manner.
Methods  The study included 1513 individuals aged ≥18 years : 339 patients with substance use disorders, 125 patients with schizophrenia, 342 patients with depression, 136 patients with bipolar disorder, 431 patients with obsessive-­compulsive disorder (OCD), and 140 healthy controls. The Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-­Short Form was used to investigate childhood traumatic experiences, and the Addiction Severity Index, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Yale-­Brown Obsessive-­ Compulsive Scale were used to assess mental disorder severity. Correlation and multivariate logistic regression were analysed between adverse childhood experiences and clinical features.
Results  Levels of adverse childhood experiences were significantly different among different mental disorders. Moreover, 25.8\% of patients with substance use disorders reported childhood trauma, which was significantly higher than found in the other four psychiatric disorder groups. Emotional abuse scores were positively correlated with disease severity: the higher the total trauma score, the more severe the mental disorder.
Conclusions  Adverse childhood experiences are a common phenomenon in those with mental disorders, and the level of trauma affects mental disorder severity. Emotional abuse is closely related to many mental disorders. The incidence or severity of mental disorders can be reduced in the future by reducing the incidence of adverse childhood experiences or by timely intervention in childhood trauma.},

	abstract = {Background
With the popularity of computers, the internet, and the global spread of COVID-19, more and more attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients need timely interventions through the internet. At present, there are many online intervention schemes may help these patients. It is necessary to integrate data to analyze their effectiveness.

Objectives
Our purpose is to integrate the ADHD online interventions trials, study its treatment effect and analyze its feasibility, and provide reference information for doctors in other institutions to formulate better treatment plans.

Methods
We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane libraries. We didn't limit the start date and end date of search results. Our last search was on December 1, 2021. The keyword is ADHD online therapy. We used the Cochrane bias risk tool to assess the quality of included studies, used the standardized mean difference (SMD) as an effect scale indicator to measure data. Random effects model, subgroup analysis were used to analyze the data.

Results
Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified, including 261 patients with ADHD. These studies showed that online interventions was more effective than waiting list in improving attention deficit and social function of adults and children with ADHD. The attention deficit scores of subjects were calculated in six studies. The sample size of the test group was 123, the sample size of the control group was 133, and the combined SMD was −0.73 (95\% confidence interval: −1.01, −0.44). The social function scores of subjects were calculated in six studies. The sample size of the experimental group was 123 and the control group was 133. The combined SMD was −0.59 (95\% confidence interval: −0.85, −0.33).

Conclusions
The results show that online interventions of ADHD may be an effective intervention. In the future, we need more online intervention researches to improve the symptoms of different patients, especially for some patients who have difficulties in accepting face-to-face treatment.},

	abstract = {"From one of our greatest chroniclers of technology and society, the definitive biography of iconic serial visionary Stewart Brand, from the Merry Pranksters and the generation-defining Whole Earth Catalog to the marriage of environmental consciousness and hacker capitalism and the rise of a new planetary culture-the story behind so many other stories. Stewart Brand has long been famous if you knew who he was, but for many people outside the counterculture, early computing, or the environmental movement, he is perhaps best known for his famous mantra "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." Steve Jobs's endorsement of these words as his code to live by is fitting; Brand has played many roles, but one of the most important is as a model for how to live. The contradictions are striking: A blond-haired WASP with a modest family inheritance, he went to Exeter and Stanford and was an army veteran, but in California in the 1960s he was an artist and a photographer in the thick of the LSD revolution. While tripping on acid on the roof of his building, he envisioned how valuable it would be for humans to see a photograph of the planet they shared from space, an image that in the end landed on the cover of his Whole Earth Catalog, the defining publication of the counterculture. He married a Native American woman and was committed to protecting indigenous culture, which connected to a broader environmentalist mission that has been a through line of his life. At the same time, he has outraged purists because of his pragmatic embrace of useful technologies, including nuclear power, in the fight against climate change. The famous tagline promise of his catalog was "Access to Tools"; with rare exceptions he rejected politics for a focus on direct power. It was no wonder, then, that he was early to the promise of the computer revolution and helped define it for the wider world. Unlike most people, who make a mark in one field, Brand has a life that can be hard to fit onto one screen. John Markoff, also a great chronicler of tech culture, has done something extraordinary in unfolding the rich, twisting story of Brand's life against its proper landscape. As Markoff makes marvelously clear, the streams of individualism, respect for science, environmentalism, and embrace of Eastern and indigenous thought that flow through Brand's entire life form a powerful gestalt, a California state of mind that has a hegemonic power to this day. At its best, it is the wellspring for a true planetary consciousness that may be the best hope we humans collectively have"--},

The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018114684). A fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis using the Hedges’ g (ES) estimate was performed. The analysis revealed significant impairment in BD individuals with medium effect sizes in various aspects of impulsivity – response inhibition (ES = 0.49; p {\textless} 0.0001), delay of gratification (ES = 0.54; p {\textless} 0.0001) and inattention (ES = 0.49; p {\textless} 0.0001) – and in decision-making (ES = 0.61, p = 0.0002), but no significant impairment in risk-taking behaviour (ES = 0.41; p = 0.0598). Furthermore, we found significant heterogeneity between studies for decision-making and risk-taking behaviour but not for impulsivity. Impaired risk-taking behaviour was significant in a subgroup of BD-I and euthymic individuals (ES = 0.92; p {\textless} 0.0001) with no significant heterogeneity. A stratification analysis revealed comparable results in euthymic and noneuthymic individuals for impulsivity. Our findings suggest that behaviour impulsivity is elevated in all phases of BD, representing a core and clinically relevant feature that persists beyond mood symptoms. More studies about decision-making and risk-taking are necessary to establish if they are impaired in BD and to analyze the role of mood state.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jad.2013.02.018},
	abstract = {Background
Risk-taking behaviours during hypomanic states are recognised, however the high-risk nature of some behaviours—including the potential for harm to both the individual and others—has not been detailed in the research literature. The current study examines risk-taking behaviours and their consequences (including their potential for impairment) in those with a bipolar II condition.
Method
Participants were recruited from the Sydney-based Black Dog Institute Depression Clinic. Diagnostic assignment of bipolar II disorder was based on clinician judgement and formal DSM-IV criteria. Participants completed a series of detailed questions assessing previous risk-taking behaviours during hypomanic states.
Results
The sample comprised a total of 93 participants. Risk-taking behaviours during hypomania included spending significant amounts of money, excessive alcohol or drug use, dangerous driving and endangering sexual activities. Key consequences included interpersonal conflict, substantial financial burden and feelings of guilt, shame and remorse. Despite recognition of the risks and consequences associated with hypomanic behaviours, less than one-fifth of participants agreed that hypomania should be treated because of the associated risks.
Limitations
Study limitations included a cross-sectional design, reliance on self-report information, lack of controlling for current mood state, and comprised a tertiary referral sample that may be weighted to more severe cases. Findings may therefore not be generalisable and require replication.
Conclusions
Risk-taking behaviours during hypomania are common, and often linked with serious consequences. Whilst hypomania is often enjoyed and romanticised by patients—leading to ambivalence around treatment of such states—careful consideration of the impact of risk-taking behaviour is necessary, while the study raises the question as to what is ‘impairment’ in hypomania. Findings should advance clinical management by identifying those high-risk behaviours that would benefit from pre-emptive weighting in developing individual's wellbeing plans for managing the condition.},

One should expect to see an equally severe burden in informal caregivers. The literature was reviewed in order to provide a foundation upon which to build nursing interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Several characteristics of bipolar mania—patient aggressiveness, lack of insight, and financial problems—were identified as severe burdens to caregivers. Professionals might not have a total view of the extent of the burden in caregivers. This review could not link the patients' mania or hypomania to factors that were described in other literature on caregiver burden related to bipolar disorder, regardless of the type of episode. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: There is a need for further research in this area to make more explicit the burden on caregivers during times of mania or hypomania.},

Aims To testthe hypothesis that euthymic patients with bipolar disorder would exhibit impairment in verbal learning and memory and executive function compared with healthy controls matched for age, gender and premorbid IQ.
Method Twenty euthymic patients with bipolar disorder were matched, on a case-by-case basis, to twenty healthy community controls.Cases and controls were tested with a battery of neuropsychological tests.
Results Impairments were found in cases compared with controls in tests of verballearning and memory.Verbal learning and memory correlated negatively with the number of manic episodes.
Conclusions Impaired verbal learning and memory may be a trait variable in bipolar disease.There are implications for adherence to medication and relapse and for the role of early treatment interventions.Prospective designs and targeting first-episode groups may help to differentiate trait v. disease process effects.},

	abstract = {Over the last ten years, HCI researchers have introduced a range of novel ways to support health behavior change, from glanceable displays to sophisticated game dynamics. Yet, this research has not had as much impact as its originality warrants. A key reason for this is that common forms of evaluation used in HCI make it difficult to effectively accumulate-and use-knowledge across research projects. This paper proposes a strategy for HCI research on behavior change that retains the field's focus on novel technical contributions while enabling accumulation of evidence that can increase impact of individual research projects both in HCI and the broader behavior-change science. The core of this strategy is an emphasis on the discovery of causal effects of individual components of behavior-change technologies and the precise ways in which those effects vary with individual differences, design choices, and contexts in which those technologies are used.},

	abstract = {A core tradition of HCI lies in the experimental evaluation of the effects of techniques and interfaces to determine if they are useful for achieving their purpose. However, our individual analyses tend to stand alone, and study results rarely accrue in more precise estimates via meta-analysis: in a literature search, we found only 56 meta-analyses in HCI in the ACM Digital Library, 3 of which were published at CHI (often called the top HCI venue). Yet meta-analysis is the gold standard for demonstrating robust quantitative knowledge. We treat this as a user-centered design problem: the failure to accrue quantitative knowledge is not the users’ (i.e. researchers’) failure, but a failure to consider those users’ needs when designing statistical practice. Using simulation, we compare hypothetical publication worlds following existing frequentist against Bayesian practice. We show that Bayesian analysis yields more precise effects with each new study, facilitating knowledge accrual without traditional meta-analyses. Bayesian practices also allow more principled conclusions from small-n studies of novel techniques. These advantages make Bayesian practices a likely better fit for the culture and incentives of the field. Instead of admonishing ourselves to spend resources on larger studies, we propose using tools that more appropriately analyze small studies and encourage knowledge accrual from one study to the next. We also believe Bayesian methods can be adopted from the bottom up without the need for new incentives for replication or meta-analysis. These techniques offer the potential for a more user- (i.e. researcher-) centered approach to statistical analysis in HCI.},

	doi = {10.2196/mhealth.4160},
	abstract = {Background: A dramatic rise in health-tracking apps for mobile phones has occurred recently. Rich user interfaces make manual logging of users’ behaviors easier and more pleasant, and sensors make tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing overall statistics, attractive visualization of tracked data, or simple tailoring based on age, gender, and overall calorie or activity information. There are a lack of systems that can perform automated translation of behavioral data into specific actionable suggestions that promote healthier lifestyle without any human involvement.
Objective: MyBehavior, a mobile phone app, was designed to process tracked physical activity and eating behavior data in order to provide personalized, actionable, low-effort suggestions that are contextualized to the user’s environment and previous behavior. This study investigated the technical feasibility of implementing an automated feedback system, the impact of the suggestions on user physical activity and eating behavior, and user perceptions of the automatically generated suggestions.
Methods: MyBehavior was designed to (1) use a combination of automatic and manual logging to track physical activity (eg, walking, running, gym), user location, and food, (2) automatically analyze activity and food logs to identify frequent and nonfrequent behaviors, and (3) use a standard machine-learning, decision-making algorithm, called multi-armed bandit (MAB), to generate personalized suggestions that ask users to either continue, avoid, or make small changes to existing behaviors to help users reach behavioral goals. We enrolled 17 participants, all motivated to self-monitor and improve their fitness, in a pilot study of MyBehavior. In a randomized two-group trial, investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either MyBehavior’s personalized suggestions (n=9) or nonpersonalized suggestions (n=8), created by professionals, from a mobile phone app over 3 weeks. Daily activity level and dietary intake was monitored from logged data. At the end of the study, an in-person survey was conducted that asked users to subjectively rate their intention to follow MyBehavior suggestions.
Results: In qualitative daily diary, interview, and survey data, users reported MyBehavior suggestions to be highly actionable and stated that they intended to follow the suggestions. MyBehavior users walked significantly more than the control group over the 3 weeks of the study (P=.05). Although some MyBehavior users chose lower-calorie foods, the between-group difference was not significant (P=.15). In a poststudy survey, users rated MyBehavior’s personalized suggestions more positively than the nonpersonalized, generic suggestions created by professionals (P{\textless}.001).
Conclusions: MyBehavior is a simple-to-use mobile phone app with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, MyBehavior represents the first attempt to create personalized, contextualized, actionable suggestions automatically from self-tracked information (ie, manual food logging and automatic tracking of activity). Lessons learned about the difficulty of manual logging and usability concerns, as well as future directions, are discussed.},

An electronic observation of campus computer laboratories provided an aﬃrmative answer, following which a survey of computer lab users was conducted to understand theoretical mechanisms governing self-reported loyalty to computers. In particular, it explored whether individual diﬀerences relating to psychological anthropomorphism and/ or preference for consistency played a role in human loyalty toward computers. Results indicate that anthropomorphism more strongly predicts ‘hardcore loyalty’ to computers whereas consistency is more strongly associated with ‘reinforcing loyalty.’ This paper discusses theoretical and practical implications of these ﬁndings.},

Differences within and between media systems mean we should be very cautious about direct comparisons between different echo chambers, but underlying patterns of audience overlap, and the continued popularity of mainstream outlets, often preclude the formation of large partisan echo chambers.},

Using a content analysis of 102,827 tweets from \#RIPTwitter, a recent hashtag-based backlash to rumors about introducing algorithmic curation to Twitter’s timeline, this study addresses the nature of user resistance in the form of the complaints being expressed, folk theories of the algorithmic system espoused by users, and how these folk theories potentially frame user reactions. We find that resistance to algorithmic change largely revolves around expectation violation, with folk theories acting as frames for reactions such that more detailed folk theories are expressed through more specific reactions to algorithmic change.},

The aim of the present study was to improve our understanding of the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness. Speciﬁcally, we examined how Facebook motives and two relationship-speciﬁc forms of adolescent loneliness are associated longitudinally. Cross-lagged analysis based on data from 256 adolescents (64\% girls, Mage ¼ 15.88 years) revealed that peer-related loneliness was related over time to using Facebook for social skills compensation, reducing feelings of loneliness, and having interpersonal contact. Facebook use for making new friends reduced peer-related loneliness over time, whereas Facebook use for social skills compensation increased peer-related loneliness over time. Hence, depending on adolescents’ Facebook motives, either the displacement or the stimulation hypothesis is supported. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

The present paper focuses on the polarization of opinions regarding COVID-19 prevention measures in survey data and on Twitter in the German-speaking regions of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The level of polarization is measured by dispersion and bimodality in the opinions based on the sentiment in Twitter data and the agreement in the survey data. Our paper, however, goes beyond existing research as we consider data from both sources separately and comparatively. For this purpose, we matched individuals’ survey responses and tweets for those respondents who shared their Twitter account information. The analyses show that vaccination is more polarizing compared to mask wearing and contact tracing in both sources, that polarization of opinions is more pronounced in the survey data compared to the Twitter data, but also that individuals’ opinions about the COVID-19 measures are consistent in both sources. We believe our ﬁndings will provide valuable insights for integrating survey data and Twitter data to investigate opinion polarization.},

Thus, this study used a U.S. representative sample to test the privacy calculus’ generalizability and extend its theoretical framework by including both self-withdrawal behaviors and privacy self-efficacy. Results confirmed the extended privacy calculus model. Moreover, both privacy concerns and privacy self-efficacy positively predicted use of self-withdrawal. With regard to predicting self-disclosure in SNSs, benefits outweighed privacy concerns; regarding self-withdrawal, privacy concerns outweighed both privacy self-efficacy and benefits.},

A series of experiments addressed whether there are systematic differences in information processing styles between chronically heavy and light media multitaskers. A trait media multitasking index was developed to identify groups of heavy and light media multitaskers. These two groups were then compared along established cognitive control dimensions. Results showed that heavy media multitaskers are more susceptible to interference from irrelevant environmental stimuli and from irrelevant representations in memory. This led to the surprising result that heavy media multitaskers performed worse on a test of task-switching ability, likely due to reduced ability to filter out interference from the irrelevant task set. These results demonstrate that media multitasking, a rapidly growing societal trend, is associated with a distinct approach to fundamental information processing.},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of e-health interventions varies greatly. Despite this, there has been relatively little formal consideration of how differences in the design of an intervention (i.e., how the content is delivered) may explain why some interventions are more effective than others. This review primarily examines the use of the Internet to provide educational and self-management interventions to promote health. The article develops hypotheses about how the design of these interventions may be associated with outcomes. In total, 52 published reports from both a diversity sample and a representative sample were reviewed using techniques from Critical Interpretive Synthesis. Four core interactive design features were identified that may mediate the effects of intervention design on outcomes: Social context and support, contacts with intervention, tailoring, and self-management. A conceptual framework to summarize the design of e-health interventions delivered using the Internet is proposed. The framework provides a guide for systematic research to identify the effects of specific design features on intervention outcomes and to identify the mechanisms underlying any effects. To optimize the design of e-health interventions more work is needed to understand how and why these design features may affect intervention outcomes and to investigate the optimal implementation and dosage of each design feature.},

	abstract = {A growing number of investigators have commented on the lack of models to inform the design of behavioral intervention technologies (BITs). BITs, which include a subset of mHealth and eHealth interventions, employ a broad range of technologies, such as mobile phones, the Web, and sensors, to support users in changing behaviors and cognitions related to health, mental health, and wellness.
We propose a model that conceptually defines BITs, from the clinical aim to the technological delivery framework. The BIT model defines both the conceptual and technological architecture of a BIT. Conceptually, a BIT model should answer the questions why, what, how (conceptual and technical), and when. While BITs generally have a larger treatment goal, such goals generally consist of smaller intervention aims (the \&\#34;why\&\#34;) such as promotion or reduction of specific behaviors, and behavior change strategies (the conceptual \&\#34;how\&\#34;), such as education, goal setting, and monitoring. Behavior change strategies are instantiated with specific intervention components or \&\#8220;elements\&\#8221; (the \&\#34;what\&\#34;). The characteristics of intervention elements may be further defined or modified (the technical \&\#34;how\&\#34;) to meet the needs, capabilities, and preferences of a user. Finally, many BITs require specification of a workflow that defines when an intervention component will be delivered. The BIT model includes a technological framework (BIT-Tech) that can integrate and implement the intervention elements, characteristics, and workflow to deliver the entire BIT to users over time. This implementation may be either predefined or include adaptive systems that can tailor the intervention based on data from the user and the user\&\#8217;s environment.
The BIT model provides a step towards formalizing the translation of developer aims into intervention components, larger treatments, and methods of delivery in a manner that supports research and communication between investigators on how to design, develop, and deploy BITs.},

This is the question this conceptual paper attempts to address. This paper proposes a definition of sustainable consumer behavior and applies a theory-based, conceptual framework to develop action-taking programs in sustainable consumption education. Sustainable consumer behavior is defined as consumer acts that consider current and future interests of themselves and others when they purchase and use market goods. The behavior change theory used here refers to the transtheoretical model of behavior change (TTM), a commonly used behavior change theory in health and finance. The paper demonstrates how to facilitate the development of sustainable consumer behavior in education programs based on principles outlined in TTM with specific examples. Implications for education policies and future research are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Policy makers have embraced financial education as a necessary antidote to the increasing complexity of consumers' financial decisions over the last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1\% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for “just-in-time” financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior.

	abstract = {Self-management interventions promote illness management among adults with chronic health conditions. Little is known regarding the processes by which these interventions have their effects. The present study examined how Living Well, an effective self-management intervention for adults with serious mental illness, led to health behavior change in a randomized controlled trial. A convenience subset (N = 15) of participants completed qualitative interviews regarding the feasibility/acceptability of Living Well. An inductive secondary qualitative analysis, using a combination of interpretive phenomenological and social constructivist approaches, was conducted to examine processes of change. Results indicate that Living Well provided information and knowledge, opportunities for learning from others and real-world practice, and an interpersonally supportive environment. These active ingredients led to enhanced self-awareness, confidence, sense of control, and behavior and health status changes among participants. These findings are considered in the context of prominent behavior change theories such as social cognitive theory and self-regulation.},

In this model (FBM), behavior is a product of three factors: motivation, ability, and triggers, each of which has subcomponents. The FBM asserts that for a person to perform a target behavior, he or she must (1) be sufficiently motivated, (2) have the ability to perform the behavior, and (3) be triggered to perform the behavior. These three factors must occur at the same moment, else the behavior will not happen. The FBM is useful in analysis and design of persuasive technologies. The FBM also helps teams work together efficiently because this model gives people a shared way of thinking about behavior change.},

However, optimisation of digital intervention delivery is challenged by low usage, high attrition and small effect sizes. Whilst a number of conceptual frameworks and models exist to guide intervention planning and development, insufficient attention has been paid to how existing psychological theory could inform the optimal implementation and delivery of the design features commonly used in digital health behaviour change interventions. This paper provides a critical review of psychological theories and models in order to consider their implications for the design of digital interventions. The theories reviewed include theories of: persuasion and attitude change; motivation; volition and self-regulation; patient preferences for participation in medical decision making; and social support. A set of theory-based guidelines is provided to inform the development of future interventions.},

	abstract = {Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

The employees who fail to join the plan or who participate at a very low level appear to be saving at less than the predicted life cycle savings rates. Behavioral explanations for this behavior stress bounded rationality and self‐control and suggest that at least some of the low‐saving households are making a mistake and would welcome aid in making decisions about their saving. In this paper, we propose such a prescriptive savings program, called Save More Tomorrow™ (hereafter, the SMarT program). The essence of the program is straightforward: people commit in advance to allocating a portion of their future salary increases toward retirement savings. We report evidence on the first three implementations of the SMarT program. Our key findings, from the first implementation, which has been in place for four annual raises, are as follows: (1) a high proportion (78 percent) of those offered the plan joined, (2) the vast majority of those enrolled in the SMarT plan (80 percent) remained in it through the fourth pay raise, and (3) the average saving rates for SMarT program participants increased from 3.5 percent to 13.6 percent over the course of 40 months. The results suggest that behavioral economics can be used to design effective prescriptive programs for important economic decisions.},

	abstract = {The popularity of New Year's resolutions suggests that people are more likely to tackle their goals immediately following salient temporal landmarks. If true, this little-researched phenomenon has the potential to help people overcome important willpower problems that often limit goal attainment. Across three archival field studies, we provide evidence of a “fresh start effect.” We show that Google searches for the term “diet” (Study 1), gym visits (Study 2), and commitments to pursue goals (Study 3) all increase following temporal landmarks (e.g., the outset of a new week, month, year, or semester; a birthday; a holiday). We propose that these landmarks demarcate the passage of time, creating many new mental accounting periods each year, which relegate past imperfections to a previous period, induce people to take a big-picture view of their lives, and thus motivate aspirational behaviors.

	abstract = {Background and aims The “process-model” of self-control proposes that the ego-depletion effect is better explained by a switch between interest in “have-to” labor and cognitive “want-to” leisure, rather than being mainly due to a decrease in cognitive resources, as advanced by the “strength-model” of self-control. However, it is currently difficult to disentangle the “process-model” from the “strength-model” of self-control. Here, we employed a stepwise approach, featuring three studies, for testing the process model of self-control. Methods In Study 1, we created a list of 30 self-control events for characterizing “have-to” conducts in the daily life. In Study 2, mental visualization of effortful self-control events (“have-to”) and monetary risk-taking (“want-to”) were employed for testing the strength-model of self-control. In Study 3, to test the process-model of self-control, participants were simply required to read self-control (or neutral) sentences. Results Study 1 provided evidence regarding external validly for the list of self-control events. Study 2 showed that mental visualization of effortful self-control events increases subsequent monetary risk-taking. Study 3 highlighted that the brief apparition of a self-control-related sentence was sufficient for increasing risk-taking. These patterns were evidenced in the trial with the less advantageous gain/loss ratio. Discussion Altogether these findings support the process-model of self-control in showing that triggering the semantic content of a “have-to” conduct, without its actual execution, is sufficient for modulating subsequent “want-to” activity. Conclusion These findings could contribute to advancing current knowledge on how the high availability of ready-to-consume rewards in modern environments is redefining humans’ self-control ability.},

	abstract = {Mental health problems are becoming more common while access to treatment is often not available to everyone who needs help. Recent advances in information technology, the wide availability of the internet, the emergence of smartphones and their common usage worldwide raise hope for more treatment options for mental health disorders. Many mobile phone apps that claim to assist in treating a variety of mental health disorders are already available, and the number of such apps continues to increase. The availability of such apps raises many questions about their effectiveness, suitable treatment methods, possibilities for use alongside traditional treatment methods, possible risks and other uncertainties. Beside mobile apps, internet-based apps are also being introduced with similar sets of challenges and ambiguities. One area of research that is gaining a lot of attention recently is Persuasive System Design and Behavior Change. Persuasive System Design is considered one solution that has the potential to help solve the challenges of lack of user motivation and adherence when utilizing mental health applications. The goal of this paper is to perform a literature review, in order to determine the most essential requirements for a persuasively designed mental health application. As part of this process, the challenges and requests of the end-user will be taken into account in order to make recommendations for the future design of such applications.},

Model constructs were measured at three points in time at each organization: preimplementation, one month postimplementation, and three months postimplementation. The extended model was strongly supported for all four organizations at all three points of measurement, accounting for 40\%–60\% of the variance in usefulness perceptions and 34\%–52\% of the variance in usage intentions. Both social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntariness, and image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use) significantly influenced user acceptance.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Without standardized definitions of the techniques included in behavior change interventions, it is difficult to faithfully replicate effective interventions and challenging to identify techniques contributing to effectiveness across interventions. This research aimed to develop and test a theory-linked taxonomy of generally applicable behavior change techniques (BCTs).
DESIGN: Twenty-six BCTs were defined. Two psychologists used a 5-page coding manual to independently judge the presence or absence of each technique in published intervention descriptions and in intervention manuals.
RESULTS: Three systematic reviews yielded 195 published descriptions. Across 78 reliability tests (i.e., 26 techniques applied to 3 reviews), the average kappa per technique was 0.79, with 93\% of judgments being agreements. Interventions were found to vary widely in the range and type of techniques used, even when targeting the same behavior among similar participants. The average agreement for intervention manuals was 85\%, and a comparison of BCTs identified in 13 manuals and 13 published articles describing the same interventions generated a technique correspondence rate of 74\%, with most mismatches (73\%) arising from identification of a technique in the manual but not in the article.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing standardized definitions of BCTs included in behavioral interventions and highlight problematic variability in the reporting of intervention content.},

	abstract = {"A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics--one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought. Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever 'speak for themselves.' Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed."-- Provided by publisher},

Despite its primarily biological roots, the onset and course of the disorder have also been related to psychosocial factors such as early adverse experiences and related maladaptive schemas. Several researchers proposed a schema therapeutic model to treat patients with BD. In this paper, we further develop the theoretical model and elaborate on seven elements that were found effective in the psychosocial interventions with individuals with BD: monitoring mood and early symptoms of relapse, recognizing and management of stressful situations and interpersonal conflicts, creating a relapse prevention plan, stabilizing the sleep/wake cycle and daily routine, encouraging the use of medication, and reducing self-stigma and substance use. Apart from that, we describe the elements of the schema work with patients who suffer from BD. Illustrative clinical cases accompany the theoretical framework. The research of the schema therapy with patients with severe mental illnesses has only recently started developing. The presented paper also aims to encourage further research in this area and highlight potentially beneficial research goals.},

	abstract = {Background: Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness that results in significant morbidity and mortality. While pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment, adjunctive psychotherapy can improve outcomes. However, access to therapy is limited. Smartphones and other technologies can increase access to therapeutic strategies that enhance self-management while simultaneously augmenting care by providing adaptive delivery of content to users as well as alerts to providers to facilitate clinical care communication. Unfortunately, while adaptive interventions are being developed and tested to improve care, information describing the components of adaptive interventions is often not published in sufficient detail to facilitate replication and improvement of these interventions.
Objective: To contribute to and support the improvement and dissemination of technology-based mental health interventions, we provide a detailed description of the expert system for adaptively delivering content and facilitating clinical care communication for LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention for individuals with bipolar disorder.
Methods: Information from empirically supported psychotherapies for bipolar disorder, health psychology behavior change theories, and chronic disease self-management models was combined with user-centered design data and psychiatrist feedback to guide the development of the expert system.
Results: Decision points determining the timing of intervention option adaptation were selected to occur daily and weekly based on self-report data for medication adherence, sleep duration, routine, and wellness levels. These data were selected for use as the tailoring variables determining which intervention options to deliver when and to whom. Decision rules linking delivery of options and tailoring variable thresholds were developed based on existing literature regarding bipolar disorder clinical status and psychiatrist feedback. To address the need for treatment adaptation with varying clinical statuses, decision rules for a clinical status state machine were developed using self-reported wellness rating data. Clinical status from this state machine was incorporated into hierarchal decision tables that select content for delivery to users and alerts to providers. The majority of the adaptive content addresses sleep duration, medication adherence, managing signs and symptoms, building and utilizing support, and keeping a regular routine, as well as determinants underlying engagement in these target behaviors as follows: attitudes and perceptions, knowledge, support, evaluation, and planning. However, when problems with early warning signs, symptoms, and transitions to more acute clinical states are detected, the decision rules shift the adaptive content to focus on managing signs and symptoms, and engaging with psychiatric providers.
Conclusions: Adaptive mental health technologies have the potential to enhance the self-management of mental health disorders. The need for individuals with bipolar disorder to engage in the management of multiple target behaviors and to address changes in clinical status highlights the importance of detailed reporting of adaptive intervention components to allow replication and improvement of adaptive mental health technologies for complex mental health problems.},

	abstract = {Background: Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness with high morbidity and mortality rates. Even with pharmacological treatment, frequent recurrence of episodes, long episode durations, and persistent interepisode symptoms are common and disruptive. Combining psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy improves outcomes; however, many individuals with bipolar disorder do not receive psychotherapy. Mental health technologies can increase access to self-management strategies derived from empirically supported bipolar disorder psychotherapies while also enhancing treatment by delivering real-time assessments, personalized feedback, and provider alerts. In addition, mental health technologies provide a platform for self-report, app use, and behavioral data collection to advance understanding of the longitudinal course of bipolar disorder, which can then be used to support ongoing improvement of treatment.
Objective: A description of the theoretical and empirically supported framework, design, and protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention for individuals with bipolar disorder, is provided to facilitate the ability to replicate, improve, implement, and disseminate effective interventions for bipolar disorder. The goal of the trial is to determine the effectiveness of LiveWell for reducing relapse risk and symptom burden as well as improving quality of life (QOL) while simultaneously clarifying behavioral targets involved in staying well and better characterizing the course of bipolar disorder and treatment response.
Methods: The study is a single-blind RCT (n=205; 2:3 ratio of usual care vs usual care plus LiveWell). The primary outcome is the time to relapse. Secondary outcomes are percentage time symptomatic, symptom severity, and QOL. Longitudinal changes in target behaviors proposed to mediate the primary and secondary outcomes will also be determined, and their relationships with the outcomes will be assessed. A database of clinical status, symptom severity, real-time self-report, behavioral sensor, app use, and personalized content will be created to better predict treatment response and relapse risk.
Results: Recruitment and screening began in March 2017 and ended in April 2019. Follow-up ended in April 2020. The results of this study are expected to be published in 2022.
Conclusions: This study will examine whether LiveWell reduces relapse risk and symptom burden and improves QOL for individuals with bipolar disorder by increasing access to empirically supported self-management strategies. The role of selected target behaviors (medication adherence, sleep duration, routine, and management of signs and symptoms) in these outcomes will also be examined. Simultaneously, a database will be created to initiate the development of algorithms to personalize and improve treatment for bipolar disorder. In addition, we hope that this description of the theoretical and empirically supported framework, intervention design, and study protocol for the RCT of LiveWell will facilitate the ability to replicate, improve, implement, and disseminate effective interventions for bipolar and other mental health disorders.

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/287sq},
	abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with excessive pleasure-seeking risk-taking behaviors that often characterize its clinical presentation. However, the mechanisms of risk-taking behavior are not well-understood in BD. Recent data suggest prior substance use disorder (SUD) in BD may represent certain trait-level vulnerabilities for risky behavior. This study examined the mechanisms of risk-taking and the role of SUD in BD via mathematical modeling of behavior on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Three groups—18 euthymic BD with prior SUD (BD+), 15 euthymic BD without prior SUD (BD-), and 33 healthy comparisons (HC)—completed the BART. We modeled behavior using 4 competing hierarchical Bayesian models, and model comparison results favored the Exponential-Weight Mean-Variance (EWMV) model, which encompasses and delineates five cognitive components of risk-taking: prior belief, learning rate, risk preference, loss aversion, and behavioral consistency. Both BD groups, regardless of SUD history, showed lower behavioral consistency than HC. BD+ exhibited more pessimistic prior beliefs (relative to BD- and HC) and reduced loss aversion (relative to HC) during risk-taking on the BART. Traditional measures of risk-taking on the BART (adjusted pumps, total points, total pops) detected no group differences. These findings suggest that reduced behavioral consistency is a crucial feature of risky decision-making in BD and that SUD history in BD may signal additional trait vulnerabilities for risky behavior even when mood symptoms and substance use are in remission. This study also underscores the value of using mathematical modeling to understand behavior in research on complex disorders like BD.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades Bayesian methods have been gaining popularity in many scientific disciplines. However, to this date, they are rarely part of formal graduate statistical training in clinical science. Although Bayesian methods can be an attractive alternative to classical methods for answering certain research questions, they involve a heavy “overhead” (e.g., advanced mathematical methods, complex computations), which pose significant barriers to researchers interested in adding Bayesian methods to their statistical toolbox. To increase the accessibility of Bayesian methods for psychopathology researchers, this paper presents a gentle introduction of the Bayesian inference framework and a tutorial on implementation. We first provide a primer on the key concepts of Bayesian inference and major implementation considerations related to Bayesian estimation. We then demonstrate how to apply hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) to experimental psychopathology data. Using a real dataset collected from two clinical groups (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) and a healthy comparison sample on a psychophysical gaze perception task, we illustrate how to model individual responses and group differences with probability functions respectful of the presumed underlying data-generating process and the hierarchical nature of the data. We provide the code with explanations and the data used to generate and visualize the results to facilitate learning. Finally, we discuss interpretation of the results in terms of posterior probabilities and compare the results with those obtained using a traditional method.},

	doi = {10.2196/11473},
	abstract = {Background: Relatives of people experiencing bipolar mood episodes or psychosis face a multitude of challenges (eg, social isolation, limited coping strategies, and issues with maintaining relationships). Despite this, there is limited informational and emotional support for people who find themselves in supporting or caring roles. Digital technologies provide us with an opportunity to offer accessible tools, which can be used flexibly to provide evidence-based information and support, allowing relatives to build their understanding of mental health problems and learn from others who have similar experiences. However, to design tools that are useful to relatives, we first need to understand their needs.
Objective: The aim of this study was to use a user-centered design approach to develop an accessible Web-based intervention, based on the Relatives Education And Coping Toolkit (REACT) booklet, to support the informational and emotional needs of relatives of people experiencing psychosis or bipolar disorder.
Methods: We engaged relatives of people with experiences of bipolar disorder or psychosis in workshops to identify their needs and design requirements for developing a Web-based version of a paper-based toolkit. We used a 2-phase qualitative approach to explore relatives’ views on content, design, and functionalities, which are considered to be engaging and useful in a Web-based intervention. In phase 1, we consulted 24 relatives in 2 workshops to better understand their existing support infrastructure, their barriers for accessing support, unmet needs, and relatives’ views on online support. On the basis of the results of these workshops, we developed a set of design considerations to be explored in a smaller workshop. Workshop 3 then involved working with 2 digitally literate relatives to design a usable and acceptable interface for our Web-based toolkit. Finally, in phase 2, we conducted a heuristic evaluation to assess the usability of the toolkit.
Results: Our findings indicated that relatives require technologies that (1) they can place their trust in, particularly when discussing a highly sensitive topic, (2) enable learning from the lived experiences of others while retaining confidentiality, and (3) they can work through at their own pace in a personalized manner.
Conclusions: Our study highlights the need for providing a trustworthy, supportive tool where relatives can engage with people who have similar experiences to their own. Our heuristic evaluation showed promise in terms of perceived usability of the REACT Web-based intervention. Through this work, we emphasize the need to involve stakeholders with various characteristics, including users with limited computer literacy or experience in online support.},

Objective: To develop an online based psychological intervention (Space from Money Worries) to tackle the psychological mechanisms underlying the relationship between poor mental health and ﬁnancial difﬁculties, and to conduct an initial evaluation of the acceptability and preliminary efﬁcacy of the intervention. Materials and Methods: 30 participants accessing Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services completed GAD-7 to measure anxiety and PHQ-9 to measure depression upon signing up to the online intervention and again 4 to 8 weeks after this. Participants also completed a measure of perceived ﬁnancial distress/wellbeing and a “Money and Mental Health Scale” constructed for the evaluation.
Results: Overall, 77\% (n = 23) completed the intervention and follow-up assessments. Intent to Treat Analysis showed that there were statistically signiﬁcant improvements in symptoms of depression, anxiety, improved perceived ﬁnancial wellbeing and reduced scores on the money and mental health scale. The vast majority of participants rated each module positively.
Conclusions: Space from Money Worries appears to be acceptable and may lead to improvements in mental health, perceived ﬁnancial wellbeing and a reduced relationship between ﬁnancial difﬁculties and poor mental health. However, future research with a larger sample and a control group are needed to conﬁrm that these changes are due to the intervention.},

	abstract = {We present a method to conduct automated surveys over WhatsApp, a popular cross-platform messaging service. The method relies on a combination of the WhatsApp Business API as well as the Twilio and Google platforms to design the survey flow, send and receive survey messages automatically, and facilitate data processing. Respondents complete the survey entirely within the WhatsApp application in the form of a chat conversation. WhatsApp surveys incur relatively low costs to both respondents and researchers and facilitate continued engagement with mobile populations as users can retain their WhatsApp number even if they change SIM cards and phone numbers. We describe the use of this method with two case studies where we surveyed refugees and migrants in Colombia, as well as resettled refugees in the U.S. The case studies offer preliminary evidence that automated surveys over WhatsApp provide a viable alternative for surveying and panel data collection. While the method is not without limitations, it offers a promising research tool with opportunities for diverse implementation and empirical study given the widespread global use of WhatsApp. We offer documentation and a public code repository as supplementary materials to support researchers in applying this method in other contexts.},

Design The guidelines for systematic literature reviews of the Joanna Briggs Institute were followed. Methods The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases were searched for concept analyses published in the past 20 years. Findings A total of 26 concept analyses were identified that had been published on self-care, self-care agency, self-monitoring, self-management, self-management support, symptom management, and self-efficacy. Differences and commonalities in the examined literature were identified, and a model was delineated, explaining the relations among the various concepts from the nursing perspective. Conclusions The healthcare literature has broadly described self-care and related concepts; however, consensus on the definitions remains beyond our reach and should not be expected, due to the different perspectives and paradigms from which the concepts are interpreted. From a nursing perspective, self-care can be considered a broad concept encompassing the other concepts, which describe more specific individual levels of activities and processes. Clinical Relevance Nurses are actively involved in disease management and self-management support as well as in promoting self-care in healthy and sick people. Referring to a model on self-care and related concepts could avoid misinterpretations in nursing practice, research, and policy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is resurgent interest in the concept and practice of self-care as a means to improve the health, wellness and wellbeing of individuals, and as an avenue to mitigate financial pressures and growing demands on health and social care systems worldwide. An ongoing challenge has been the lack of clarity on the specific nature and entire scope of self-care, coupled to a lack of a universal or widely accepted framework that could support the conceptualisation and study of selfcare in its totality, in all settings and from different perspectives. OBJECTIVES: To advance a comprehensive yet pragmatic and widely accessible framework to support the conceptualisation of self-care in its totality, in order to facilitate the development, commissioning, evaluation and study of self-care initiatives across a variety of settings. METHOD AND FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT: A pragmatic review of the academic and lay literature was undertaken to identify extant theories and conceptual models of self-care. Following a content analysis, the models were characterised, and a configuration matrix was constructed to illustrate the key components and main themes of each model. These themes were organised into a number of domains which were grouped together into cardinal dimensions of self-care. The dimensions of self-care were consolidated in an inclusive framework and visually depicted on a schema to illustrate their inter-relationship. RESULTS: We identified a total of 32 candidate models, theories and frameworks of self-care. Characterising these models led to the identification of various themes and domains. These were found to naturally group into four cardinal dimensions of self-care: (1) Activities, (2) Behaviours, (3) Context, and (4) Environment. A new model was synthesised to illustrate the relationship between each dimension on a configuration matrix resulting in the creation of the Self-Care Matrix (SCM). CONCLUSION: The Self-Care Matrix (SCM) is a useful framework that can be used to conceptualise and frame the totality of self-care and its various interlinked elements. SCM is intended for use by all stakeholders who are interested in the study, development, commissioning and evaluation of self-care initiatives.},

	abstract = {Objectives
There is extensive literature from various disciplines on self-care, an important aspect of nursing intervention via evaluation and education, but its meaning remains unprecise due to the difficulty integrating the diverse definitions developed over time across disciplines. Therefore, it is vital to clarify the meaning of self-care and formulate the defining attributes, antecedents, and consequences to self-care.
Methods
Walker and Avant’s concept analysis approach was used to analyze the concept of self-care. A search of the literature was completed using the databases CINAHL, PubMed, and EBSCOhost for years 1975–2020; literature search included peer-review articles, full-text publications, and available in English. A total of 31 articles were reviewed, and saturation was reached.
Results
An extensive review of the literature revealed salient characteristics that reflected the most frequently used terms associated with the concept. Guided by Walker and Avant’s method, three defining attributes emerged as common themes: awareness, self-control, and self-reliance.
Conclusions
A clarified definition was identified: the ability to care for oneself through awareness, self-control, and self-reliance in order to achieve, maintain, or promote optimal health and well-being.},

	abstract = {Background
Worldwide, the increasing prevalence of chronic disease evokes concern on a number of levels, including quality of life, health care costs and workforce issues to meet increasing demands on services. One response has been a shift in governmental health policy to encourage greater involvement of the chronically ill individual in their health care through participation in self-management programmes. Embedded in self-management programmes is the underlying concept of self-care, a complex and multidimensional phenomenon.
Objective
This paper explores the development of the concept of self-care through health related literature and reviews the factors that have shaped the concept.
Design
A comprehensive search of the literature was undertaken drawing principally on key electronic databases of the health literature, augmented with reference list searching.
Data sources
English language publications indexed in CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED, MEDLINE and PsycInfo with no limit on date of publication.
Review methods
Abstracts were reviewed against the inclusion criteria and quality appraisal undertaken. Twenty-two studies were reviewed.
Results
Many definitions of self-care exist and a consensual definition has not been reached. The current concept of self-care has been shaped by many different social, economic and political factors and is embedded in diverse theoretical perspectives and paradigms.
Conclusion
An understanding of the underlying theoretical perspectives and paradigms embedded within acute and chronic disease management will facilitate nurses’ engagement in the debate, practice within appropriate ethical boundaries and support individuals, families and communities more effectively in managing chronic disease.},

A moderated mediation model was conducted to test whether self-care confidence mediated the association between depressive symptoms and self-care maintenance, and whether resilience moderated the direct and indirect effects of depressive symptoms after adjustment for covariates.Depressive symptoms reduced self-care maintenance indirectly by decreasing self-care confidence (indirect effect: −0.22, 95\% confidence interval: −0.36, −0.11), and this pathway was only significant for patients with moderate and high levels and not with low levels of resilience. Resilience also moderated the direct effects of depressive symptoms on self-care maintenance such that the negative association between depressive symptoms and self-care maintenance was reversed by the existence of high resilience.Resilience moderated the direct and indirect effects of depressive symptoms through self-care confidence on self-care maintenance in heart failure patients. Efforts to improve self-care maintenance by targeting depressive symptoms may be more effective when considering self-care confidence in patients with moderate to high levels of resilience.},

At all sites, 120 consecutive adult patients, who visit their general practitioner for any reason, filled in a self-administered 27-item questionnaire. This addresses patients\&\#x2019; self-care practices for common colds. Separately, the subjective level of discomfort when having a common cold, knowing about the diseases\&\#x2019; self-limited nature, and medical and sociodemographic data are requested. Additionally, physicians are surveyed on their use of and recommendations for self-care practices. We are interested in investigating which self-care practices for common colds are used, whether the number of self-care practices used is influenced by knowledge about the self-limited nature of the disease, and the subjective level of discomfort when having a cold and to identify potential adverse interactions with chronic physician-prescribed medications. Further factors that will be considered are, for example, demographic characteristics, chronic conditions, and sources of information for self-care practices. All descriptive and analytical statistics will be performed on the pooled dataset and stratified by country and site. \textit{Discussion.} To our knowledge, COCO is the first European survey on the use of self-care practices for common colds. The study will provide new insight into patients\&\#x2019; and general practitioners\&\#x2019; self-care measures for common colds across Europe.},

illnesses. This reality introduces a new chronic disease paradigm: the patient-professional
partnership, involving collaborative care and self-management education. Self-management
education complements traditional patient education in supporting patients
to live the best possible quality of life with their chronic condition. Whereas
traditional patient education offers information and technical skills, self-management
education teaches problem-solving skills. A central concept in self-management
is self-efficacy—confidence to carry out a behavior necessary to reach
a desired goal. Self-efficacy is enhanced when patients succeed in solving
patient-identified problems. Evidence from controlled clinical trials suggests
that (1) programs teaching self-management skills are more effective than
information-only patient education in improving clinical outcomes; (2) in
some circumstances, self-management education improves outcomes and can reduce
costs for arthritis and probably for adult asthma patients; and (3) in initial
studies, a self-management education program bringing together patients with
a variety of chronic conditions may improve outcomes and reduce costs. Self-management
education for chronic illness may soon become an integral part of high-quality
primary care.},

	abstract = {Self-care is important at all stages of life and health status to promote well-being, prevent disease, and improve health outcomes. Currently, there is a need to better conceptualize self-care in the general adult population and provide an instrument to measure self-care in this group. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the Self-Care Inventory (SCI), a theory-based instrument to measure self-care in the general adult population. Based on the Middle Range Theory of Self-Care, the 20-item SCI was developed with three scales: Self-Care Maintenance (8 items), Self-Care Monitoring (6 items), and Self-Care Management (6 items). A cross sectional study with a US-based sample (n = 294) was conducted to test the SCI. Internal validity was assessed with Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Internal consistency reliability was assessed with Cronbach alpha for unidimensional scales or composite reliability and the global reliability index for multidimensional scales. Construct validity was investigated with Pearson correlation to test the relationship between general self-efficacy, positivity, stress, and self-care scores. The Self-Care Maintenance and Management scales were multidimensional and the Self-Care Monitoring scale was unidimensional. The global reliability index for multidimensional scales was 0.85 (self-care maintenance) and 0.88 (self-care management). Cronbach alpha coefficient of the self-care monitoring scale was 0.88. Test-retest reliability was 0.81 (self-care maintenance), 0.91 (self-care monitoring), and 0.76 (self-care management). The General Self-Efficacy Scale was positively related to all three self-care scale scores: self-care maintenance r = 0.46, p {\textless} 0. 001, self-care monitoring r = 0.31, p {\textless} 0. 001, and self-care management r = 0.32, p {\textless} 0. 001. The positivity score was positively related to self-care maintenance (r = 0.42, p {\textless} 0. 001), self-care monitoring (r = 0.29, p {\textless} 0. 001), and self-care management (r = 0.34, p {\textless} 0. 001) scores. The perceived stress was positively related to the self-care management (r = 0.20, p {\textless} 0. 001) score.

	abstract = {Aim: To review the literature related to self-care and health promotion for elders and to develop an understanding of self-care as a health resource. Background: Self-care may improve health and prevent illness and disabilities in elders. Although studies of self-care are numerous, the significance of the concept as a health resource for elders lacks clarity. Before 1989, research focused principally on medical self-care at the expense of health care, and self-care was seen more as supplementary to professional health care rather than as a health-promoting approach in health care. Method: In this integrative review from 2006, we selected theoretical and empirical articles published between 1990 and 2006, where self-care was related to elders’ health promotion. Data were extracted from primary sources and included definitions of self-care, critical attributes, antecedents, goals and outcomes. We interactively compared data and display matrices to describe self-care as a health resource. Results: Fifty-seven articles addressed health self-care and were integrated into a framework of self-care as a health resource of elders. Self-care was identified as a two-dimensional construct including action capabilities and processes for health in self-care practice. The capabilities consisted of fundamental capabilities, power capabilities and performance capabilities. The action processes included a process of life experience, a learning process and an ecological process. Conclusion: This review offers insight into self-care as a significant health resource of elders with different health status. It suggests that an elder's self-care ability is determined by the interaction of various sub-resources and conditions and emphasizes the constantly evolving nature of self-care. The framework may be of use in clinical practice, policy-making and research into health care of frail or robust elders.},

	abstract = {With the rapid deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and the variety of ways in which IoT-connected sensors collect and use personal data, there is a need for transparency, control, and new tools to ensure that individual privacy requirements are met. To develop these tools, it is important to better understand how people feel about the privacy implications of IoT and the situations in which they prefer to be notiﬁed about data collection. We report on a 1,007-participant vignette study focusing on privacy expectations and preferences as they pertain to a set of 380 IoT data collection and use scenarios. Participants were presented with 14 scenarios that varied across eight categorical factors, including the type of data collected (e.g. location, biometrics, temperature), how the data is used (e.g., whether it is shared, and for what purpose), and other attributes such as the data retention period. Our ﬁndings show that privacy preferences are diverse and context dependent; participants were more comfortable with data being collected in public settings rather than in private places, and are more likely to consent to data being collected for uses they ﬁnd beneﬁcial. They are less comfortable with the collection of biometrics (e.g. ﬁngerprints) than environmental data (e.g. room temperature, physical presence). We also ﬁnd that participants are more likely to want to be notiﬁed about data practices that they are uncomfortable with. Finally, our study suggests that after observing individual decisions in just three data-collection scenarios, it is possible to predict their preferences for the remaining scenarios, with our model achieving an average accuracy of up to 86\%.},

	abstract = {The central assumption of behavioral ecology is that natural selection has shaped individuals with the capacity to make decisions that balance the fitness costs and benefits of behavior. A number of factors shape the fitness costs and benefits of maternal care, but we lack a clear understanding how they, taken together, play a role in the decision-making process. In animal studies, the use of experimental methods has allowed for the tight control of these factors. Standard experimentation is inappropriate in human behavioral ecology, but vignette experiments may solve the problem. I used a confounded factorial vignette experiment to gather 640 third-party judgments about the maternal care decisions of hypothetical women and their children from 40 female karo Batak respondents in rural Indonesia. This allowed me to test hypotheses derived from parental investment theory about the relative importance of five binary factors in shaping maternal care decisions with regard to two distinct scenarios. As predicted, access to resources—measured as the ability of a woman to provide food for her children—led to increased care. A handful of other factors conformed to prediction, but they were inconsistent across scenarios. The results suggest that mothers may use simple heuristics, rather than a full accounting for costs and benefits, to make decisions about maternal care. Vignettes have become a standard tool for studying decision making, but have made only modest inroads to evolutionarily informed studies of human behavior.},

The aim of this article is to describe and compare six conceptually different multiple imputation methods, alongside the commonly used complete case analysis, and to explore whether the choice of methodology for handling missing data might impact clinical conclusions drawn from a regression model when data are categorical.Methods:In addition to the commonly used complete case analysis, we tested the following six imputation methods: multiple imputation using expectation?maximization with bootstrapping, multiple imputation using multiple correspondence analysis, multiple imputation using latent class analysis, multiple hot deck imputation and multivariate imputation by chained equations with two different model specifications: logistic regression and random forests. The methods are tested on real data from a questionnaire-based study in the Norwegian opioid maintenance treatment programme.Results:All methods performed relatively well when the sample size was large (n?=?1000). For a smaller sample size (n?=?200), the regression estimates depend heavily on the level of missing. When the amount of missing was ?20\%, in particular, complete case analysis, hot deck and random forests had biased estimates with too low coverage. Multiple imputation using multiple correspondence analysis had the best performance all over.Conclusion:The choice of missing handling methodology has a significant impact on the clinical interpretation of the accompanying statistical analyses. With missing data, the choice of whether to impute or not, and choice of imputation method, can influence clinical conclusion drawn from a regression model and should therefore be given sufficient consideration.},

Additionally, individuals with bipolar disorder experience higher morbidity and mortality rates relative to the general population due to increased commission of dangerous behaviors, including increased substance abuse and driving while under the influence of drugs and alcohol, unprotected sex, and elevated risk of suicidality. While commission of such risky behaviors contributes to functional impairment and increased risk of mortality, there has been little targeted attention to their treatment in patients with bipolar illness. The aim of this study was to facilitate patients' recognition and reduction of risk-taking behavior. One-hundred one outpatients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosed bipolar disorder were screened. Using a multiple-baseline single-subject design, seven of these individuals with bipolar disorder who engaged in frequent risk-taking behaviors received treatment using a mindfulness-based imaginal exposure from the Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention program. Visual inspection revealed declines in self-reported risk-taking for each participant, beginning during the intervention or follow-up. Current measurement tools are limited, and better methods are needed to assess risk-taking adequately. It was concluded that the mindfulness-based imaginal exposure can be a useful tool to reduce risk-taking behaviors in individuals with bipolar disorder.},

	abstract = {Background
There is amassing evidence that risky decision-making in bipolar disorder is related to reward-based differences in frontostriatal regions. However, the roles of early attentional and later cognitive processes remain unclear, limiting theoretical understanding and development of targeted interventions.
Methods
Twenty euthymic bipolar disorder and 19 matched control participants played a Roulette task in which they won and lost money. Event-related potentials and source analysis were used to quantify predominantly sensory-attentional (N1), motivational salience (feedback-related negativities [FRN]), and cognitive appraisal (P300) stages of processing. We predicted that the bipolar disorder group would show increased N1, consistent with increased attentional orienting, and reduced FRN, consistent with a bias to perceive outcomes more favorably.
Results
As predicted, the bipolar disorder group showed increased N1 and reduced FRN but no differences in P300. N1 amplitude was additionally associated with real-life risk taking, and N1 source activity was reduced in visual cortex but increased activity in precuneus, frontopolar, and premotor cortex, compared to those of controls.
Conclusions
These findings demonstrate an early attentional bias to reward that potentially drives risk taking by priming approach behavior and elevating reward salience in the frontostriatal pathway. Although later cognitive appraisals of these inputs may be relatively intact in remission, interventions targeting attention orienting may also be effective in long-term reduction of relapse.},

Written by world experts in the field of bipolar disorder, The Treatment of Bipolar Disorder: Integrative Clinical Strategies and Future Directions provides readers with a concise and comprehensive guide to the integrative management of bipolar disorder. This resource contains 31 chapters on the various management choices available, from both established and novel treatment areas, such as psychoeducation, psychotherapeutic interventions, neuromodulatory approaches and novel therapeutic targets.  The complexity and diversity of the management choices available makes this a continually evolving field and necessitates forward thinking. By both discussing the current management of bipolar disorder, and the future developments available, this resource provides all clinicians working with patients with bipolar disorder an up-to-date and reflective guide to its management and what the future holds.},

	abstract = {Training in mindfulness has been shown to improve a variety of psychological disorders as well as physical conditions. Additionally, mindfulness training has been shown to reduce risk-taking behaviors following several weeks of training. Reducing risk-taking behaviors is of particular importance in regard to specific mental health problems, such as substance use and eating disorders. Many studies that examine the effects of mindfulness utilize training programs that are several weeks in duration. However, some evidence indicates that brief, single-use mindfulness practices can have substantial effects on changing emotion and cognition in laboratory settings. The present study examined the immediate effects of a brief, single-use mindful body scan practice on risk-taking behavior in a laboratory setting. Participants included 153 undergraduate students at a major university in the southern USA. The experimental design was a randomized trial using an active control group, which engaged in a mind-wandering exercise. Results indicated that there was no significant interaction of condition by time on scores from the state mindfulness measure or the risk-taking task, yet main effects of time were observed for both variables. Findings suggest that the brief mindful body scan practice did not differentially effect mindfulness or risk-taking compared to the mind-wandering control exercise. However, there was a small, significant correlation observed between change in state mindfulness and change in risk taking for the full sample, suggesting a relationship between the variables of interest, albeit in the opposite direction as expected. Implications and limitations of the present study are discussed.},

This focus on clinical outcomes contrasts with the emergent recovery paradigm, which prioritises adaptation to serious mental illness and movement towards personally meaningful goals. The aim of this review is to encourage innovation in the psychological management of BD by considering three recovery-oriented trends in the literature. First, the importance of quality of life as a target of recovery-oriented clinical work is considered. Second, the recent staging approach to BD is described, and we outline implications for psychosocial interventions tailored to stage. Finally, we review evidence suggesting that mindfulness-based psychosocial interventions have potential across early, middle and late stages of BD. It is concluded that the humanistic emphasis of the recovery paradigm provides a timely stimulus for development of a next generation of psychosocial treatments for people with BD.},

The objective here was to test the hypothesis that for people with ≥10 episodes of BD, a brief online mindfulness-based intervention (ORBIT 2.0) improves quality of life (QoL) relative to a Psychoeducation control. Method: A rater-masked, pragmatic superiority randomized clinical trial compared ORBIT 2.0 with active control. Both interventions were 5-week coach-supported programs with treatment as usual continued. Inclusion criteria included age 18–65 years, confirmed diagnosis of BD, and history of ≥10 episodes. Measures were collected at baseline, postintervention, and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. The main outcome was QoL, measured on the Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder (Brief QoL.BD) at 5 weeks, using intention-to-treat analyses. Results: Among N = 302 randomized participants, the primary hypothesis was not supported (Treatment × Time β = −0.69, 95\% CI [−2.69, 1.31], p = .50). The main effect of Time was not significant in either condition, indicating no improvement in either group. Recruitment was feasible, the platform was safe, both interventions were highly acceptable, but usage was suboptimal. Post hoc analyses found both interventions effective for participants not in remission from depression at baseline. Conclusions: In people with late-stage BD, an online mindfulness-based intervention was not superior to psychoeducational control in improving QoL. Online delivery was found to be safe and acceptable. Future interventions may need to be higher intensity, address engagement challenges, and target more symptomatic individuals.

	abstract = {Background
Self-management (SM) is increasingly emphasised as a key aspect of bipolar disorder (BD) treatment. However, little is known about the subjective experience of SM, which might have both positive and negative impacts. The present study aimed to advance this literature through qualitative investigation of the experiences of people with BD who participated in an SM intervention targeting quality of life (QoL).
Methods
Forty-three individuals with BD engaged with an SM intervention and were later questioned about personal experiences of engagement with the intervention, including attempts to enact self-management strategies. Thematic analysis was used to identify important aspects of the experience of SM in BD.
Results
Four themes describing people's experiences of SM were identified: 1) SM for BD is empowering, 2) individual responsibility to self-manage BD, 3) SM strategies lack power to control BD, and 4) the relationship of SM to the healthcare system.
Limitations
Potential limitations to generalisability may occur from self-selection bias in favour of SM and the QoL-focused nature of the present intervention.
Conclusions
The findings of this research generate novel insights into ways in which individuals with BD engage with SM interventions. For most people with BD, SM invokes a sense of empowerment and responsibility, although some feel symptoms remain beyond their control. A sense of partnership between consumers and clinicians may emerge from attention to SM, but traditional medical approaches were perceived as neglecting this aspect of care. Considerations from consumer perspectives are presented to assist clinicians and researchers utilising SM interventions in BD.},

Twenty-three participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental (n = 11) or control group (n = 12).

	abstract = {Background
Risk-taking behaviours during hypomanic states are recognised, however the high-risk nature of some behaviours—including the potential for harm to both the individual and others—has not been detailed in the research literature. The current study examines risk-taking behaviours and their consequences (including their potential for impairment) in those with a bipolar II condition.
Method
Participants were recruited from the Sydney-based Black Dog Institute Depression Clinic. Diagnostic assignment of bipolar II disorder was based on clinician judgement and formal DSM-IV criteria. Participants completed a series of detailed questions assessing previous risk-taking behaviours during hypomanic states.
Results
The sample comprised a total of 93 participants. Risk-taking behaviours during hypomania included spending significant amounts of money, excessive alcohol or drug use, dangerous driving and endangering sexual activities. Key consequences included interpersonal conflict, substantial financial burden and feelings of guilt, shame and remorse. Despite recognition of the risks and consequences associated with hypomanic behaviours, less than one-fifth of participants agreed that hypomania should be treated because of the associated risks.
Limitations
Study limitations included a cross-sectional design, reliance on self-report information, lack of controlling for current mood state, and comprised a tertiary referral sample that may be weighted to more severe cases. Findings may therefore not be generalisable and require replication.
Conclusions
Risk-taking behaviours during hypomania are common, and often linked with serious consequences. Whilst hypomania is often enjoyed and romanticised by patients—leading to ambivalence around treatment of such states—careful consideration of the impact of risk-taking behaviour is necessary, while the study raises the question as to what is ‘impairment’ in hypomania. Findings should advance clinical management by identifying those high-risk behaviours that would benefit from pre-emptive weighting in developing individual's wellbeing plans for managing the condition.},

	abstract = {Interest has grown in using mindfulness meditation to treat conditions featuring excessive impulsivity. However, while prior studies find that mindfulness practice can improve attention, it remains unclear whether it improves other cognitive faculties whose deficiency can contribute to impulsivity. Here, an eight-week mindfulness intervention did not reduce impulsivity on the go/no-go task or Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), nor produce changes in neural correlates of impulsivity (i.e. frontostriatal gray matter, functional connectivity, and dopamine levels) compared to active or wait-list control groups. Separately, long-term meditators (LTMs) did not perform differently than meditation-naïve participants (MNPs) on the go/no-go task. However, LTMs self-reported lower attentional impulsivity, but higher motor and non-planning impulsivity on the BIS-11 than MNPs. LTMs had less striatal gray matter, greater cortico-striatal-thalamic functional connectivity, and lower spontaneous eye-blink rate (a physiological dopamine indicator) than MNPs. LTM total lifetime practice hours (TLPH) did not significantly relate to impulsivity or neurobiological metrics. Findings suggest that neither short- nor long-term mindfulness practice may be effective for redressing impulsive behavior derived from inhibitory motor control or planning capacity deficits in healthy adults. Given the absence of TLPH relationships to impulsivity or neurobiological metrics, differences between LTMs and MNPs may be attributable to pre-existing differences.},

Dialectical behavior therapy skills training (DBT-ST) reduces emotion dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD). Preliminary evidence suggests that use of DBT skills mediates changes seen in BPD treatments. Therefore, we assessed DBT-ST as a stand-alone, transdiagnostic treatment for emotion dysregulation and DBT skills use as a mediator of outcome. Forty-four anxious and/or depressed, non-BPD adults with high emotion dysregulation were randomized to 16 weeks of either DBT-ST or an activities-based support group (ASG). Participants completed measures of emotion dysregulation, DBT skills use, and psychopathology every 2 months through 2 months posttreatment. Longitudinal analyses indicated that DBT-ST was superior to ASG in decreasing emotion dysregulation (d = 1.86), increasing skills use (d = 1.02), and decreasing anxiety (d = 1.37) but not depression (d = 0.73). Skills use mediated these differential changes. Participants found DBT-ST acceptable. Thirty-two percent of DBT-ST and 59\% of ASG participants dropped treatment. Fifty-nine percent of DBT-ST and 50\% of ASG participants complied with the research protocol of avoiding ancillary psychotherapy and/or medication changes. In summary, DBT-ST is a promising treatment for emotion dysregulation for depressed and anxious transdiagnostic adults, although more assessment of feasibility is needed.},

Aims To testthe hypothesis that euthymic patients with bipolar disorder would exhibit impairment in verbal learning and memory and executive function compared with healthy controls matched for age, gender and premorbid IQ.
Method Twenty euthymic patients with bipolar disorder were matched, on a case-by-case basis, to twenty healthy community controls.Cases and controls were tested with a battery of neuropsychological tests.
Results Impairments were found in cases compared with controls in tests of verballearning and memory.Verbal learning and memory correlated negatively with the number of manic episodes.
Conclusions Impaired verbal learning and memory may be a trait variable in bipolar disease.There are implications for adherence to medication and relapse and for the role of early treatment interventions.Prospective designs and targeting first-episode groups may help to differentiate trait v. disease process effects.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study aims were to address neuropsychological functioning across different states of bipolar illness and to determine relationships among clinical features, neuropsychological performance, and psychosocial functioning. METHOD: Several domains of cognitive function were examined in 30 depressed bipolar patients (DSM-IV criteria for major depression, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score ≥17), 34 manic or hypomanic bipolar patients (DSM-IV criteria for manic or hypomanic episode, Young Mania Rating Scale score ≥12), and 44 euthymic bipolar patients (6 months of remission, Hamilton depression scale score ≤8, and Young Mania Rating Scale score ≤6). The comparison group consisted of 30 healthy subjects without history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. A neuropsychological battery assessed executive function, attention, and verbal and visual memory. RESULTS: The three groups showed cognitive dysfunction in verbal memory and frontal executive tasks in relation to the comparison group. Low neuropsychological performance was associated with poor functional outcome. Impairment of verbal memory was related to the duration of illness and the numbers of previous manic episodes, hospitalizations, and suicide attempts. CONCLUSIONS: A poorer performance was observed in all bipolar groups regarding executive function and verbal memory in relation to the healthy comparison subjects. These cognitive difficulties, especially related to verbal memory, may help explain the impairment regarding daily functioning, even during remission. Further studies should focus on testing, whether optimizing prophylactic pharmacological treatment and psychoeducation might reduce cognitive impairment, and whether bipolar patients would benefit from neuropsychological rehabilitation in order to reduce the impact of cognitive impairment in their overall functioning.},

A subset of participants was re-evaluated after completing six weeks of pharmacotherapy. HC demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater use of the healthy vigilance style, and signiﬁcantly lower use of maladaptive decision-making styles, than the MDD and depressed BP patients. After six weeks of treatment, neither the MDD nor BP patients reported meaningful improvements in the vigilance style of decisionmaking, but scores on most maladaptive decision-making styles declined. BP patients who remitted reported signiﬁcantly lower buckpassing and procrastination scores than healthy controls. Among MDD patients, however, the maladaptive passive buckpassing style of decision-making did not signiﬁcantly diminish. For MDD patients, reported decision-making styles may remain impaired even after achieving remission. Among BP patients, low levels of adaptive vigilance decision-making may be a trait component of the illness, whereas for MDD patients, reported maladaptive passive decision-making styles are persistent.},

If the results of short-term memory assessment in depressed patients are equivocal, a general consensus exists that memory problems are secondary to attentional dysfunctions, and reflect the inability to concentrate. Moreover, both unipolar and bipolar patients show evidence of impaired verbal learning that has been commonly interpreted as reflecting an inability to transfer information from short-term to long-term storage. According to some authors, there would be a gender-related as well age-related specificity of some disturbances. Depressed patients also show impairments of executive functions and their recent exploration through brain imaging techniques has recently permitted to formulate some general hypotheses on the possible involvement of different brain areas in MD.},

Fifty-two individuals diagnosed with BD I per the SCID, followed until remission, and 49 well-matched controls were asked to imagine and describe goals coming true. Heart rate and skin response responses were gathered as indices of sympathetic arousal. Praat analyses were used to code vocal parameters associated with arousal during goal discussions. At 6-month follow-up, the BD group completed standardized symptom severity interviews. Diagnostic groups did not differ significantly on arousal indices during goal discussion. The BD group described goals that were rated objectively as more difficult to achieve, and these more ambitious goal descriptions predicted increases in manic symptoms over time.

Furthermore, we have described the technical, ethical, and equity challenges for financial data-driven assessments and intervention methods, as well as provided a broad research agenda to address these challenges.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The classic Marshmallow Test, where children were offered a choice between one small but immediate reward (eg, one marshmallow) or a larger reward (eg, two marshmallows) if they waited for a period of time, instigated a wealth of research on the relationships among impulsive responding, self-regulation, and clinical and life outcomes. Impulsivity is a hallmark feature of self-regulation failures that lead to poor health decisions and outcomes, making understanding and treating impulsivity one of the most important constructs to tackle in building a culture of health. Despite a large literature base, impulsivity measurement remains difficult due to the multidimensional nature of the construct and limited methods of assessment in daily life. Mobile devices and the rise of mobile health (mHealth) have changed our ability to assess and intervene with individuals remotely, providing an avenue for ambulatory diagnostic testing and interventions. Longitudinal studies with mobile devices can further help to understand impulsive behaviors and variation in state impulsivity in daily life.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate an impulsivity mHealth diagnostics and monitoring app called Digital Marshmallow Test (DMT) using both the Apple and Android platforms for widespread dissemination to researchers, clinicians, and the general public.
METHODS: The DMT app was developed using Apple's ResearchKit (iOS) and Android's ResearchStack open source frameworks for developing health research study apps. The DMT app consists of three main modules: self-report, ecological momentary assessment, and active behavioral and cognitive tasks. We conducted a study with a 21-day assessment period (N=116 participants) to validate the novel measures of the DMT app.
RESULTS: We used a semantic differential scale to develop self-report trait and momentary state measures of impulsivity as part of the DMT app. We identified three state factors (inefficient, thrill seeking, and intentional) that correlated highly with established measures of impulsivity. We further leveraged momentary semantic differential questions to examine intraindividual variability, the effect of daily life, and the contextual effect of mood on state impulsivity and daily impulsive behaviors. Our results indicated validation of the self-report sematic differential and related results, and of the mobile behavioral tasks, including the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and Go-No-Go task, with relatively low validity of the mobile Delay Discounting task. We discuss the design implications of these results to mHealth research.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential for assessing different facets of trait and state impulsivity during everyday life and in clinical settings using the DMT mobile app. The DMT app can be further used to enhance our understanding of the individual facets that underlie impulsive behaviors, as well as providing a promising avenue for digital interventions.

	abstract = {Devices and programs using digital technology to foster or support behavior change (digital interventions) are increasingly ubiquitous, being adopted for use in patient diagnosis and treatment, self-management of chronic diseases, and in primary prevention. They have been heralded as potentially revolutionizing the ways in which individuals can monitor and improve their health behaviors and health care by improving outcomes, reducing costs, and improving the patient experience. However, we are still mainly in the age of promise rather than delivery. Developing and evaluating these digital interventions presents new challenges and new versions of old challenges that require use of improved and perhaps entirely new methods for research and evaluation. This article discusses these challenges and provides recommendations aimed at accelerating the rate of progress in digital behavior intervention research and practice. Areas addressed include intervention development in a rapidly changing technological landscape, promoting user engagement, advancing the underpinning science and theory, evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and addressing issues of regulatory, ethical, and information governance. This article is the result of a two-day international workshop on how to create, evaluate, and implement effective digital interventions in relation to health behaviors. It was held in London in September 2015 and was supported by the United Kingdom’s Medical Research Council (MRC), the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), the Methodology Research Programme (PI Susan Michie), and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of the United States (PI Kevin Patrick). Important recommendations to manage the rapid pace of change include considering using emerging techniques from data science, machine learning, and Bayesian approaches and learning from other disciplines including computer science and engineering. With regard to assessing and promoting engagement, a key conclusion was that sustained engagement is not always required and that for each intervention it is useful to establish what constitutes “effective engagement,” that is, sufficient engagement to achieve the intended outcomes. The potential of digital interventions for testing and advancing theories of behavior change by generating ecologically valid, real-time objective data was recognized. Evaluations should include all phases of the development cycle, designed for generalizability, and consider new experimental designs to make the best use of rich data streams. Future health economics analyses need to recognize and model the complex and potentially far-reaching costs and benefits of digital interventions. In terms of governance, developers of digital behavior interventions should comply with existing regulatory frameworks, but with consideration for emerging standards around information governance, ethics, and interoperability.},

The availability of increasingly powerful mobile and sensing technologies underpins the use of JITAIs to support health behavior, as in such a setting an individual’s state can change rapidly, unexpectedly, and in his/her natural environment.Despite the increasing use and appeal of JITAIs, a major gap exists between the growing technological capabilities for delivering JITAIs and research on the development and evaluation of these interventions. Many JITAIs have been developed with minimal use of empirical evidence, theory, or accepted treatment guidelines. Here, we take an essential first step towards bridging this gap.Building on health behavior theories and the extant literature on JITAIs, we clarify the scientific motivation for JITAIs, define their fundamental components, and highlight design principles related to these components. Examples of JITAIs from various domains of health behavior research are used for illustration.As we enter a new era of technological capacity for delivering JITAIs, it is critical that researchers develop sophisticated and nuanced health behavior theories capable of guiding the construction of such interventions. Particular attention has to be given to better understanding the implications of providing timely and ecologically sound support for intervention adherence and retention},

	abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests impulsive states may be reliably measured in the moment using ecological momentary assessment (EMA); however, research has not investigated whether the multi-factor structure of impulsive traits also characterizes impulsive states. In two independent samples spanning adolescence through young adulthood (n = 211, n = 222), we adapted global self-report measures of impulsive traits to EMA and conducted multilevel confirmatory factor analyses to characterize the within- and between-person factor structure of five impulsive traits (negative urgency, planning, persistence, sensation seeking, and positive urgency). Across both studies, factor models with one factor for each UPPS-P facet fit the data well at both levels, though some latent factors were highly correlated. Aggregated impulsive states, especially negative urgency, predicted oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, emotional problems, alcohol problems, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms. Our results suggest that EMA measures can capture a range of impulsive states that mirrors the heterogeneity seen in the trait literature.},

Both approaches neglect intraindividual variability in impulsivity and do not capture impulsivity as it occurs in real-world settings. The goal of the current study was to provide a method for assessing impulsivity in daily life that provides both between-individual and within-individual information. Participants with borderline personality disorder (BPD; n = 67) or a depressive disorder (DD; n = 38) carried an electronic diary for 28 days and responded to 9 impulsivity items up to 6 times per day. Item distributions and iterative exploratory factor analysis (EFA) results were examined to select the items that best captured momentary impulsivity. A brief 4-item scale was created that can be used for the assessment of momentary impulsivity. Model fit was good for both within- and between-individual EFA. As expected, the BPD group showed significantly higher scores on our Momentary Impulsivity Scale than the DD group, and the resulting scale was moderately correlated with common trait impulsivity scales.},

Thus, the impact of such interventions is minimized by a misalignment between intervention design and user behavior. Digital micro interventions are highly focused interventions delivered in the context of a person’s daily life with little burden on the individual. We propose that these interventions have the potential to disruptively expand the reach of beneficial therapeutics by lowering the bar for entry to an intervention and the effort needed for purposeful engagement. This paper provides a conceptualization of digital micro interventions, their component parts, and principles guiding their use as building blocks of a larger therapeutic process (ie, digital micro intervention care). The model represented provides a structure that could improve the design, delivery, and research on digital micro interventions and ultimately improve behavioral and mental health care and care delivery.},

	abstract = {Background
The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency of compulsive buying in bipolar disorder (BD), to compare it with healthy controls, and to search if there is a difference between bipolar cases with and without compulsive buying in terms of sociodemographic qualities, temperament, clinical characteristics and comorbid diagnoses.
Methods
One-hundred outpatient cases diagnosed as BD according to DSM-IV were evaluated consecutively. Following the diagnosis interview (SCID-I and II) the subjects completed the mood disorders registry form, Compulsive Buying Scale and TEMPS-A.
Results
Compulsive buying scores were higher in bipolar patients than healthy controls (p{\textless}0.001). Cases with compulsive buying revealed higher cyclothymic and irritable temperament scores than other bipolar patients (p=0.029 vs 0.045). Premenstrual syndrome and postpartum onset were more frequent, while psychotic symptoms were less in compulsive buyer bipolar patients (p=0.002, 0.009 vs 0.034). Severity of episode was lower (p=0.01), number of episodes was higher (p=0.009). Acute onset and remission before and after maintenance treatment were more frequent in patients with compulsive buying (p=0.011 and p=0.011). Full remission between episodes was 100\%. Cases with axis-1 and axis-2 comorbidities demonstrated higher compulsive buying scores (p=0.025 and 0.005).
Limitations
Treatment regimen differences between patients are a limitation of the study.
Conclusions
This is the first study to relate compulsive buying with the clinical characteristics of BD. Our results reveal that compulsive buying in BD occurs together with mood episodes which are not very severe, but frequent and with abrupt onset.},

	abstract = {Objectives
There is extensive literature from various disciplines on self-care, an important aspect of nursing intervention via evaluation and education, but its meaning remains unprecise due to the difficulty integrating the diverse definitions developed over time across disciplines. Therefore, it is vital to clarify the meaning of self-care and formulate the defining attributes, antecedents, and consequences to self-care.
Methods
Walker and Avant’s concept analysis approach was used to analyze the concept of self-care. A search of the literature was completed using the databases CINAHL, PubMed, and EBSCOhost for years 1975–2020; literature search included peer-review articles, full-text publications, and available in English. A total of 31 articles were reviewed, and saturation was reached.
Results
An extensive review of the literature revealed salient characteristics that reflected the most frequently used terms associated with the concept. Guided by Walker and Avant’s method, three defining attributes emerged as common themes: awareness, self-control, and self-reliance.
Conclusions
A clarified definition was identified: the ability to care for oneself through awareness, self-control, and self-reliance in order to achieve, maintain, or promote optimal health and well-being.},

Analysis supports the construct validity of an 18-item SCPS with two subscales that demonstrate strong internal validity. The SCPS is useful for social work educators, practitioners, and administrators to ascertain frequency of self-care practice and build a stronger culture of self-care. The role of SCPS in future research is discussed.},

Background Existing measures of self-care are disease-specific or behaviour-specific; no generic measure of self-care exists. Design Cross-sectional survey. Methods We developed a 20-item self-report instrument based on the Middle Range Theory of Self-Care of Chronic Illness, with three separate scales measuring Self-Care Maintenance, Self-Care Monitoring, and Self-Care Management. Each of the three scales is scored separately and standardized 0–100 with higher scores indicating better self-care. After demonstrating content validity, psychometric testing was conducted in a convenience sample of 407 adults (enrolled from inpatient and outpatient settings at five sites in the United States and ResearchMatch.org). Dimensionality testing with confirmatory factor analysis preceded reliability testing. Results The Self-Care Maintenance scale (eight items, two dimensions: illness-related and health-promoting behaviour) fit well when tested with a two-factor confirmatory model. The Self-Care Monitoring scale (five items, single factor) fitted well. The Self-Care Management scale (seven items, two factors: autonomous and consulting behaviour), when tested with a two-factor confirmatory model, fitted adequately. A simultaneous confirmatory factor analysis on the combined set of items supported the more general model. Conclusion The self-care of chronic illness inventory is adequate in reliability and validity. We suggest further testing in diverse populations of patients with chronic illnesses.},

Becoming a patient is seen as a developmental process through which a person is socialized into the health care system. The object of any socialization is the development of self-control—in this case, the development of self-care behaviors. Five models of self-care are described—naturalistic, egoistic, ideological, existential, and exchange. Several functions of self-care are outlined: to alleviate illness, to alleviate symptoms, to prevent disease, and to regulate bodily processes. Finally, the available literature on self-care and self-help groups is briefly reviewed, and suggestions are made for the establishment of a program that would lead to the development of self-care.

The purpose of this study was to examine evidence for the reliability and validity of the Scorable Self-Care Evaluation (SSCE), an 18-item assessment of observed and perceived self-care performance commonly used with persons with psychiatric disabilities.METHOD. As part of a longitudinal study, 70 adults with psychiatric disabilities were administered two cognitive measures, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and the Logical Memory subscales of the Weschler Memory Scale, at baseline, and the SSCE at follow-up. After transforming the weighted item scores, intraclass correlation coefficients were used to examine inter-rater reliability and Rasch analysis was used to examine internal consistency of the SSCE. Spearman rank-order correlations were used to examine construct validity.RESULTS. High interrater reliabilities were found for the four subscale scores (ICCs ranging from .96 to 1.00, p \&lt; .001) and the total scores (ICC =. 98, p \&lt; .001) of the SSCE. Rasch analysis indicated that no items misfit; however, some items showed a weak distribution across all possible scores. The SSCE subscale and total scores correlated to varying degrees with the cognitive measures.CONCLUSION. The SSCE has the potential to be a reliable and valid clinical measure, as demonstrated by the results of the current study. However, these results were only achieved using a transformation of the current scoring system for the SSCE, pointing to the need for further revision of the test items and scoring system.},

The loading variables included: spiritual growth, self-concept, initiative, and responsibility. Therefore, spiritual growth was more strongly related to self-care agency than self-efficacy.},

	abstract = {Background
Self-care, a key element of heart failure care, is challenging for patients with impaired cognition. Mechanisms through which cognitive impairment affects self-care are not currently well defined but evidence from other patient populations suggests that self-efficacy, or task-specific confidence, mediates the relationship between cognitive functioning and patient behaviors such as self-care.
Objective
The aim of this study was to test the mediating role of self-care confidence in the relationship between cognition and self-care behaviors.
Design
A secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional study.
Setting
Outpatient heart failure clinics in 28 Italian provinces.
Participants
628 Italian heart failure patients.
Methods
We used the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index v.6.2 to measure self-care maintenance, self-care management, and self-care confidence. Cognition was assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data.
Results
Participants were 73 years old on average (SD=11), mostly (58\%) male and mostly (77\%) in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III. The mediation model showed excellent fit (comparative fit index=1.0; root mean square error of approximation=0.02): Self-care confidence totally mediated the relationship between cognition and self-care maintenance and management.
Conclusion
Cognition affects self-care behaviors indirectly, through self-care confidence. Interventions aimed at improving self-care confidence may improve self-care, even in heart failure patients with impaired cognition.},

Further, it is suggested that individual differences in past experiences and attribution of success to skill or chance result in different levels of generalized self-efficacy expectations. To measure these generalized expectancies, a Self-efficacy Scale was developed. A factor analysis yielded two subscales: a General Self-efficacy subscale (17 items) and a Social Self-efficacy subscale (6 items). Confirmation of several predicted conceptual relationships between the Self-efficacy subscales and other personality measures (i.e., Locus of Control, Personal Control, Social Desirability, Ego Strength, Interpersonal Competence, and Self-esteem) provided evidence of construct validity. Positive relationships between the Self-efficacy Scale and vocational, educational, and military success established criterion validity.

Further, merely taking mental photos had similar effects on memory. These results provide support for the idea that photo taking induces a shift in attention toward visual aspects and away from auditory aspects of an experience. Additional findings were in line with this mechanism: Participants with a camera had better recognition of aspects of the scene that they photographed than of aspects they did not photograph. Furthermore, participants who used a camera during their experience recognized even nonphotographed aspects better than participants without a camera did. Meta-analyses including all reported studies support these findings.},

However, it is unclear how the contextual factors interact with each other. Since co-owners’ privacy attitudes are often influenced by multiple contextual factors at the same time, it is possible that the impact of one factor depends on the other factors. Through an interview and survey study with WeChat users in China, we found significant interaction effects among the contextual factors in collaborative photo sharing. The impact of one factor on co-owners’ concerns is dependent on another factor. We suggest a more holistic evaluation of contextual factors and discuss how our findings contribute to the understanding of contextual integrity framework.

	abstract = {Background
Maladaptive perfectionism is a transdiagnostic risk and maintaining factor for a range of mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder (BD). Self-compassion represents a potential protective factor against maladaptive perfectionism, however no studies to date have examined the relationship of these constructs in BD. The aim of the present study was to examine associations between maladaptive perfectionism, self-compassion and symptoms among individuals with BD.
Methods
Baseline data were collected from 302 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BD participating in an international randomised controlled trial. Participants completed measures of maladaptive perfectionism, self-compassion, symptom severity and emotion regulation difficulties. Clinician-administered measures of depression and mania severity were additionally collected. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted.
Results
Maladaptive perfectionism was positively associated with depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties. Lower levels of self-compassion correlated with greater self-reported depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties. Self-compassion partially mediated relationships between maladaptive perfectionism, depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties.
Limitations
The cross-sectional design limits conclusions about causal relationships between study variables. Results may not be generalizable to other BD populations. The role of maladaptive perfectionism and self-compassion in elevated mood states of BD remains unclear.
Conclusion
Self-compassion represents one mechanism through which maladaptive perfectionism influences symptoms of depression, anxiety and emotion regulation difficulties in BD. Self-compassion represents a modifiable treatment target; individuals with BD exhibiting maladaptive perfectionistic tendencies may benefit from interventions fostering self-compassion.},

However, a limited understanding of how and what life events are disclosed (or not) prevents designing platforms to be sensitive to life events. We ask what life events individuals disclose on a 256 participants’ year-long Facebook dataset of 14K posts against their self-reported life events. We contribute a codebook to identify life event disclosures and build regression models on factors explaining life events’ disclosures. Positive and anticipated events are more likely, whereas signifcant, recent, and intimate events are less likely to be disclosed on social media. While all life events may not be disclosed, online disclosures can refect complementary information to self-reports. Our work bears practical and platform design implications in providing support and sensitivity to life events.},

In this paper, we study self-disclosure as it occurs in newspaper comment forums. We explore a longitudinal dataset of about 60, 000 comments on 2202 news articles from four major English news websites. We start with detection of language indicative of various types of self-disclosure, leveraging both syntactic and semantic information present in texts. Specifically, we use dependency parsing for subject, verb, and object extraction from sentences, in conjunction with named entity recognition to extract linguistic indicators of self-disclosure. We then use these indicators to examine the effects of anonymity and topic of discussion on self-disclosure. We find that anonymous users are more likely to self-disclose than identifiable users, and that self-disclosure varies across topics of discussion. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for user privacy.},

Tens of millions of people each year suffer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. We explore the potential to use social media to detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individuals. We first employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of Twitter users who report being diagnosed with clinical depression, based on a standard psychometric instrument. Through their social media postings over a year preceding the onset of depression, we measure behavioral attributes relating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguistic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant medications. We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a statistical classifier that provides estimates of the risk of depression, before the reported onset. We find that social media contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in social activity, raised negative affect, highly clustered egonetworks, heightened relational and medicinal concerns, and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools for identifying the onset of major depression, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about their mental health.},

Personal informatics, chiefly concerned with investigating individuals’ engagement with personal data, has become an area of active research within Human-Computer Interaction. However, more recent research has argued that personal informatics solutions often place high demands on individuals and require knowledge, skills, and time for engaging with personal data. New advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help to reduce the cognitive burden of personal informatics and identify meaningful trends using analytical engines. Furthermore, introducing ML and AI can enable systems that provide more direct support for action, for example through predictions and recommendations. However, there are many open questions as to the design of personal informatics technologies that incorporate ML and AI. In this workshop, we will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers in personal informatics, ML, and AI to outline the design space for intelligent personal informatics solutions and develop an agenda for future research in this area.},

The fundamental unit of analysis is the single case—which can be an individual, clinic, or community—ideally with replications of effects within and/or between cases. These designs are flexible and cost-effective and can be used for treatment development, translational research, personalized interventions, and the study of rare diseases and disorders. This article provides a broad overview of the family of single-case experimental designs with corresponding examples, including reversal designs, multiple baseline designs, combined multiple baseline/reversal designs, and integration of single-case designs to identify optimal treatments for individuals into larger randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Personalized N-of-1 trials can be considered a subcategory of SCEDs that overlaps with reversal designs. Relevant issues for each type of design—including comparisons of treatments, design issues such as randomization and blinding, standards for designs, and statistical approaches to complement visual inspection of single-case experimental designs—are also discussed.},

Bayesian inference is natural for drawing inferences from N-of-1 trials because it can incorporate external and subjective information to supplement trial data as well as give straightforward interpretations of posterior probabilities as an individual’s state of knowledge about their own condition after their trial. Bayesian models are also easily augmented to incorporate specific characteristics of N-of-1 data such as trend, carryover, and autocorrelation and offer flexibility of implementation. Combining data from multiple N-of-1 trials using Bayesian multilevel models leads naturally to inferences about population and subgroup parameters such as average treatment effects and treatment effect heterogeneity and to improved inferences about individual parameters. Data from a trial comparing different diets for treating children with inflammatory bowel disease are used to illustrate the models and inferences that may be drawn. The analysis shows that certain diets were better on average at reducing pain, but that benefits were restricted to a subset of patients and that withdrawal from the study was a good marker for lack of benefit.},

	abstract = {Self-management of mental illness is a therapeutic paradigm that draws on a distinctly biomedical conceptualization of the isolability of personhood from pathology. This discourse posits a stable and rational patient/consumer who can observe, anticipate, and preside over his disease through a set of learned practices. But in the case of bipolar disorder, where the rationality of the patient is called into question, the managing self is elusive, and the disease that is managed coincides with the self. While humanist critiques of the biomedical model as applied to mental illness have argued that its logic fatalistically denies patients intentionality and effectiveness (Luhrmann, Of Two Minds: The Growing Disorder in American Psychiatry, 2000), biomedical proponents claim that psychiatry’s way of envisioning the body as under the control of the intentional mind actually returns agency to the patient/consumer. Rose (The Psychiatric Gaze, 1999) remarks that biomedical models have the potential to “[open] that which was considered natural to a form of choice” (p. 37), and that techniques of medical self-control help constitute the free embodied liberal subject who is obliged to calculate and choose. Through an examination of clinical literature as well as the practices and narratives of members of a bipolar support group, this paper explores ethnographically the possibilities for subjectivity and agency that are conditioned or foreclosed by the self-management paradigm, which seems to simultaneously confer and deny rational selfhood to bipolar patients. To express their expertise as rational self-managers, patients/consumers must, paradoxically, articulate constant suspicion toward their present thoughts and emotions, and distrust of an imagined future self. I argue that through their self-management practices, bipolar support group members model provisional and distributed forms of agency based on an elusive, discontinuous, and only partially knowable or controllable self—revealing, perhaps, the limits of the contemporary reification and medicalization of both selfhood and disease.},

Participants reported their motivations for taking a sample of photos and then rated their recollective experience of each photographed event. Across both studies, participants reported recollecting events associated with a memento goal more vividly, more positively, and with more emotional intensity than events associated with an offloading goal. As expected, events photographed with a memento goal were also rated by participants to be more reflective of a shared memory system between the participants and the camera than were events photographed with an offloading goal. These findings suggest that people?s motivations when taking photos tend to be associated with different types of recollective experiences, as well as different judgments about where personal information is located in a blended human-camera memory system.},

One aim of this review is to challenge this consumer characterisation which regards information as a public resource containing novel data that we seek out, consume, and then discard. Instead I want to focus on a very different view: where familiar information is used a personal resource that we keep, manage and (sometimes repeatedly) exploit. I call this information curation. I first summarise arguments against the consumer perspective. I then review research on three different information curation processes: keeping, management and exploitation. I describe existing work detailing how each of these processes is applied to different types of personal data, namely documents, emails, photos and web pages. The research indicates people tend to keep too much information with the exception of contacts and web pages. When managing information there are surprising benefits for strategies that rely on piles as opposed to files. And despite the emergence of desktop search, exploitation currently remains reliant on manual methods such as navigation. There are a number of new technologies that could potentially address important curation problems, but implementing these in acceptable ways remains a challenge. I conclude with a summary of outstanding research and technical questions.},

Cognitive science research shows that people’s information categorization behaviors are mood-dependent, so that positive moods induce larger, more inclusive organizational categories, whereas negative moods elicit more fine-grained organization. However, such mood-dependent organization has not been directly studied in the context of PIM. Our first, naturalistic study examines relations between people’s overall filing habits and a personality trait, neuroticism, which is commonly associated with negative mood. Our results reveal the expected mood-dependency effects; participants who report more prevalent negative mood patterns when surveyed, also create different organizational structures. Overall, they make more folders that contain fewer files and store these in deeper folder structures. The second, experimental study directly manipulated mood and examined how this affects organization of a controlled file collection. Again as predicted, participants experiencing negative moods created significantly more folders containing fewer files, and there was a trending effect of negative mood on folder depth. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for PIM arising from these novel results.},

Smartphone technology and social media have pushed the success of photography, but cannot explain it, as not all smartphone features are widely used just because they are available. We analyzed properties of human nature that have made taking and using photographs functional behaviors. We did this based on the four levels, which Nikolaas Tinbergen suggested for analyzing why animals behave in a particular way. Including findings from multiple disciplines, we developed a novel conceptual framework—the “Mental Utilization Hypothesis of Photography.” It suggests that people adopt photography because it matches with core human mental mechanisms mainly from the social domain, and people use photography as a cognitive, primarily social coping strategy. Our framework comprises a range of testable predictions, provides a new theoretical basis for future empirical investigations into photography, and has practical implications. We conclude that photography has become a human universal, which is based on context-sensitive mental predispositions and differentiates itself in the social and societal environment.},

To tackle this issue, we propose a conceptualization that conceives such memories as the outcome of co-constitutive agencies that impact contemporary mnemonic practices. We look especially at sociotechnical relationships that affect the way memory contents travel temporally and through particular contexts within localized digital environments. The empirical analysis is grounded in a case study of one of the first memory-oriented features released by Facebook in 2014, the Look Back video. We asked Facebook users to answer a questionnaire about the experience of using this feature, providing insights into the production and consumption of digital mnemonic products. Our findings point to the fact that digital traces left by users in their networks interact with the performative properties of communication systems. These interactions are articulated in mnemonic products that inspire reflections on the agency of algorithms and the meaningfulness of the resulting narratives. Acknowledging the consequences of the “third memory boom” accompanying the emergence of the connective turn in memory studies, we suggest that current digital technologies demand a more comprehensive analysis of the constellation of actors and values involved in current memory processes.},

	abstract = {We tested the use of smartphones for retrieval of pictures of long-term, salient family events. Our goal was to replicate a study conducted a decade ago where participants used digital cameras. We found that smartphones affected picture retrieval in two contrasting ways. Overall, the constant availability of smartphones increased collection size. This increased the failure percentage for pictures downloaded to computer file system folders from an average of 43\% in the original study to 71\% in the current one. On the other hand, improved smartphone retrieval technologies including timeline, search, and face recognition reduced smartphone application retrieval failures to 29\% on average. Overall, these two opposing tendencies canceled each other out, with no significant difference in failure percentage and retrieval time between the two studies. Results indicate that the magnitude of pictures is too much for us to manually handle and we must rely on technology for picture retrieval.},

Previous research notes that these Bookmarks are rarely used. However, these prior studies did not systematically observe and quantify the frequency and success of Bookmark retrievals, or compare their success with other retrieval methods. The authors address those questions in this study using the elicited personal information retrieval technique, in which they asked their 50 participants to retrieve target URLs (uniform resource locators). Each participant received 21 targets, from which five were taken from the participants? Bookmarks, and they were presented in random order to avoid raising suspicions. Although most of the participants created Bookmarks, they rarely used them for retrieval. Across all of the participants, only 41 (16\%) of these 250 bookmarked retrieval targets were actually retrieved using the Bookmark facility. Of these 41 instances when Bookmarks were used, only 9 (4\%) Bookmarks were retrieved using the Bookmarks menu hierarchy, while the remaining 32 were located in the browser?s upper bar, which was in full view of the participants. The results suggest that unless the Bookmarks were highly visible, the participants did not use them. Furthermore, for websites that the users had visited, bookmarked websites were not better retrieved than those that had not been bookmarked. The authors conclude by discussing possible explanations, as well as design and theory implications.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Previous research has repeatedly shown that people only search for files in a small minority of cases when they do not remember the file's location. The current study aimed to examine whether there is a group of hyper-searchers who search significantly more than others. Based on previous neurocognitive studies, this study aims to hypothesize that if such a group exists, they will have superior verbal memory and reduced visuospatial memory.
In total, 65 participants completed a questionnaire estimating their search percentages, as well as reporting demographic data. Verbal memory was measured using the Wechsler logical memory test, and visuospatial memory was assessed using an online card memory game.
Hyper-searchers were defined as participants with search percentage of over one standard deviation (SD) above the mean. The average search percentage of the seven participants who met this criterion was 51\% (SD = 14\%), over five times more than the other participants (M = 10\%, SD = 9\%). Similar results were obtained by re-analyzing data from four previous papers (N = 1,252). The results further confirmed the hypothesis that hyper-searchers have significantly better verbal memory than other participants, possibly making searching easier and more successful for them. Lastly, the search percentage was positively predicted by verbal memory scores and negatively predicted by visuospatial memory scores. Explanations and future research are discussed.
This preliminary study is the first to introduce the concept of hyper-searchers, demonstrate its existence and study its causes.},

I first investigate older phenomenological questions around “memory” in the science of cybernetics and then examine a genealogy of cybernetic memory. Finally, I illustrate how cybernetic memory is animated in Google Photos. This article historically examines what “memory” is understood to be in algorithmic media and how the science of cybernetics has integrated our current understanding of memory into algorithmic memory practices—the socio-technical imaginary of the past.},

Research consistently shows that users prefer retrieving files using folder navigation, rather than more flexible query-based search. But desktop search engines continue to improve, so does this mean that younger generations rely more on search as their usage habits were formed when experiencing more effective search? This study tested age effects on search use by asking 289 participants to retrieve 1,557 of their shared files. Counterintuitively, our results showed a positive correlation between age and search percentage, with participants over fifty searching over four times as much as participants in their twenties. Results were confirmed by an n = 653 combined data analysis. A possible explanation is that older participants forget the location of their files. We discuss the deep neuro-cognitive roots of navigation preference which may also explain our findings.},

This paper describes a study of curation activities performed on smartphones aiming to identify design opportunities for applications that will help users manage and organize their photo collections. Semi-structured interviews with young adults show that curation on smartphones does not happen without external triggers and is an activity that they postpone and avoid as much as possible. The most usual trigger for curation activities is running out of storage space. Rather than specialized applications participants are content with camera roll applications that are built into their phones. They do not like how photographs are mixed in the camera roll, but value the overview, chronological order and serendipity it allows in viewing. Furthermore, they appreciate automated backup of their photo collections.},

The study found that many triggers for photo reuse were either speculative or accidental and led people to reinterpret the meaning of photographs in the light of subsequent experience and social discussion. This suggests a need to support serendipitous browsing of photographs and a more fluid and provisional approach to the semantic tagging of personal media.},

Through a deeper understanding of photowork using field observation and interviews, we seek to highlight its significance as an interaction practice. At the same time, we discover how “search” as it is usually defined may have much less relevance than new ways of browsing for the design of new digital photo tools, in particular, browsing in support of the photowork activities we describe.},

In contrast with technologically determinist perspectives which have been, however latently, manifest in writing on new media, the value of exploring vernacular photography as a specifically mnemonic practice is that it turns our attention to the ways in which photographic practices are bound up with longer term social uses and cultural values. Our analysis focuses on changes in four key categories of photographic practice that relate to the analogue/ digital shift: photo-taking, photo-storing, photo-viewing, photo-sharing – all of which have consequences for the uses of photography as a mnemonic resource. They have all been altered in varying degrees by the advent of digital technologies, but with people continually making comparative evaluations of old and new, drawing on the former as a key aspect of learning how to use the latter.},

The emotional burden of worrying how to organize an overwhelming number of photographs falls more commonly on women’s shoulders. Mothers and young fathers are more likely than older fathers to make a strong effort to view digital photographs with their children on the computer. But, when the sharing process extends beyond the immediate family to maintain kinship ties, women are more likely to take on the primary responsibility for the actions surrounding the photographs, which is consistent with tenets of intensive mothering.},

	abstract = {Research to date has paid remarkably little heed to gender differences in autobiographical memory. To redress this, the author examined memory for childhood events in adult men and women remembering back to childhood, and in children themselves. Five studies were conducted, and results revealed that females consistently recalled more childhood memories than males did and were generally faster in accessing the memories recalled. Furthermore, the gender difference observed was specific to memories of events associated with emotion and was apparent across a diverse range of emotions experienced by both the self and others. The overall pattern of findings obtained is consistent with the proposition that gender-differentiated socialization processes influence the content and complexity of representations of autobiographical emotional events in memory. To some extent, then, autobiographical memory appears to be a socially constructed phenomenon. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {People often share their experiences with others who were not originally present, which provides them with both personal and interpersonal beneﬁts. However, most prior work on this form of sharing has examined the decision to share one’s experience only after the experience is over. We investigate a distinct, unexplored aspect of the sharing process: when the decision to share is already salient during an experience and hence can impact the experience itself. We examine this research question within the context of photo-taking, an increasingly ubiquitous and integral part of people’s experiences. Across two ﬁeld and three laboratory studies, we ﬁnd that relative to taking pictures for oneself (e.g., to preserve one’s memories), taking pictures with the intention to share them with others (e.g., to post on social media) reduces enjoyment of experiences. This effect occurs because taking photos with the intention to share increases self-presentational concern during the experience, which can reduce enjoyment directly, as well as indirectly by lowering engagement with the experience. We identify several factors that moderate the effect of photo-taking goals on enjoyment, such as individual differences in the extent to which individuals care about how others perceive them and the closeness of the intended audience.},

Symptomatic periods often manifest in poor financial decision-making including compulsive spending and risky behaviors. This article explores research opportunities and challenges in developing financial technologies (FinTech) to support individuals with mental health. Specifically, we focus on how objective financial data might lead to novel mental health assessment and intervention methods. We have used data from one individual with bipolar disorder (BD) (i.e., an N = 1 case study) to illustrate feasibility of collecting and analyzing objective financial data alongside mental health factors. While we have not found statistically significant trends nor our findings are generalizable beyond this case, our approach provides an insight into the potential of using objective financial data to identify early warning signs and thereby, enable preemptive care for individuals with serious mental illnesses. We have also identified challenges of accessing objective financial data. The paper outlines what data is currently available, what can be done with it, and what factors to consider when working with financial data. We have also explored future directions for developing interventions to support financial well-being and stability. Furthermore, we have described the technical, ethical, and equity challenges for financial data-driven assessments and intervention methods, as well as provided a broad research agenda to address these challenges.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder–specific psychotherapy combined with pharmacotherapy improves relapse risk, symptom burden, and quality of life, but psychotherapy is not easily accessible.To determine if a smartphone-based self-management intervention (LiveWell) can assist individuals with bipolar disorder to maintain wellness.An assessor-blind randomized clinical trial enrolled participants from March 20, 2017, to April 25, 2019, with 48-week follow-up ending on April 10, 2020. Participants were randomly assigned to usual care or usual care plus the smartphone intervention stratified by relapse risk based on initial clinical status (low risk: asymptomatic recovery; high risk: continued symptomatic, prodromal, recovering, symptomatic recovery). Participants with bipolar disorder I were recruited from clinics in the Chicago and Minneapolis-Saint Paul areas. Data were analyzed from June 19, 2020, to May 25, 2022.The smartphone-based self-management intervention consisted of an application (app), coach, and website. Over 16 weeks, participants had a coach visit followed by 6 phone calls, and they completed daily and weekly app check-ins. The app provided adaptive feedback and information for developing a personalized wellness plan, the coach provided support, and the website provided summary data and alerts.The primary outcome was time to relapse. Secondary outcomes were percentage-time symptomatic, symptom severity, and quality of life.Of the 205 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 42 [12] years; 125 female individuals [61\%]; 5 Asian [2\%], 21 Black [10\%], 13 Hispanic or Latino [6\%], 7 multiracial [3\%], 170 White [83\%], 2 unknown race [1\%]), 81 (40\%) were randomly assigned to usual care, and 124 (60\%) were randomly assigned to usual care plus the smartphone intervention. This clinical trial did not detect a reduction in relapse risk for the smartphone intervention (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.39-1.09; log-rank P = .08). However, decreased relapse was observed for low-risk individuals (HR, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.12-0.88; log-rank P = .02) but not high-risk individuals (HR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.47-1.57; log-rank P = .62). Reduced manic symptom severity was observed for low-risk individuals (mean [SE] difference, −1.4 [0.4]; P = .001) but not for high-risk individuals (mean [SE] difference, 0 [0.3]; P = .95). The smartphone-based self-management intervention decreased depressive symptom severity (mean [SE] difference, −0.80 [0.34]; P = .02) and improved relational quality of life (mean [SE] difference, 1.03 [0.45]; P = .02) but did not decrease percentage-time symptomatic (mean [SE] difference, −5.6 [4.3]; P = .20).This randomized clinical trial of a smartphone-based self-management intervention did not detect a significant improvement in the primary outcome of time to relapse. However, a significant decrease in relapse risk was observed for individuals in asymptomatic recovery. In addition, the intervention decreased depressive symptom severity and improved relational quality of life. These findings warrant further work to optimize the smartphone intervention and confirm that the intervention decreases relapse risk for individuals in asymptomatic recovery.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03088462},

	abstract = {Perhaps enticed by the promise of reduced marginal costs per customer and other “operational efficiencies”, the financial industry seems to take for granted that introducing technology into their services delivers convenience and makes it easier for people to manage their money. The overwhelmingly positive discourse that surrounds financial technologies portrays them as the inevitable next step in the evolution of money, and as driving consumer empowerment by reducing costs and improving quality of service. Research, however, has linked those very same technologies to new and existing forms of financial exclusion. This raises the question of how we can design financial technologies that promote access and fairness.

In this thesis, I take on this question by casting a critical lens over the design of financial technologies through experiences of financial difficulty and financial third party access. I conducted qualitative studies with a team inside the banking industry tasked with servicing customers deemed “vulnerable”; and with a group of people who live under the “double trouble” (Topor et al., 2016) of mental illness and financial difficulty. The latter trialled a new financial third party access digital service for 3 months. These varied perspectives on financial difficulty and third party access reveal the unintended consequences of introducing technology into our interactions with money, and the theories and assumptions concealed in the design of existing financial technologies.

Based on the insights of these studies, and a synthesis of the literature on the nature of money, this thesis contributes alternative paradigms that may help us design financial technologies differently. Such technologies would reflect an understanding of money as a social relation, and of our finances as a collaborative endeavour. Rather than focusing on efficiency, resource optimisation and asset protection, they would encourage flexibility, complementarity, reflection, appropriation, positive forms of security, collaboration and participation. By designing financial technologies under different theoretical premises and with different priorities, we may promote access, fairness and democratic oversight in financial service provision, particularly for those experiencing financial difficulty.},

	abstract = {Background
The development of mobile computing technology has enabled the delivery of psychological interventions while people go about their everyday lives. The original visions of the potential of these “ecological momentary interventions” were presented over a decade ago, and the widespread adoption of smartphones in the intervening years has led to a variety of research studies exploring the feasibility of these aspirations. However, there is a dearth of research describing the different dimensions, characteristics, and features of these interventions, as constructed.

Objective
To provide an overview of the definitions given for “ecological momentary interventions” in the treatment of common mental health disorders, and describe the set of technological and interaction possibilities which have been used in the design of these interventions.

Methods
A systematic search identified relevant literature published between 2009 and 2020 in the PubMed, PsycInfo, and ACM Guide to the Computing Literature databases. Following screening, data were extracted from eligible articles using a standardized extraction worksheet. Selected articles were then thematically categorized.

Results
The search identified 583 articles of which 64 met the inclusion criteria. The interventions target a range of mental health problems, with diverse aims, intervention designs and evaluation approaches. The studies employed a variety of features for intervention delivery, but recent research is overwhelmingly comprised of studies based on smartphone apps (30 of 42 papers that described an intervention). Twenty two studies employed sensors for the collection of data in order to provide just-in-time support or predict psychological states.

Conclusions
With the shift towards smartphone apps, the vision for EMIs has begun to be realised. Recent years have seen increased exploration of the use of sensors and machine learning, but the role of humans in the delivery of EMI is also varied. The variety of capabilities exhibited by EMIs motivates development of a more precise vocabulary for capturing both automatic and human tailoring of these interventions.},

This study aimed to develop and test the usability of one of the first smartphone app-delivered ecological momentary interventions for gambling (GamblingLess: Curb Your Urge), with key Australian stakeholders (ten consumers, nine gambling clinicians, and ten gambling researchers). Based on relapse prevention principles, the intervention comprised 10 activities to curb cravings, which were recommended to participants based on ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of gambling cravings. Participants tested the usability of the intervention over one-week and reported on the content’s helpfulness, the EMA’s relevance/burden, the Mobile App Rating Scale, and open-ended items assessing content and functionality. The intervention content, helpfulness, and usability were rated highly in quantitative and qualitative assessments. Participants liked practical and instructive content, but suggested that the intervention could be more engaging, interactive, and varied, and the number of EMA questions per timepoint could be reduced. These preliminary findings were promising for the intervention’s acceptability and usability. All groups indicated that they would recommend this app, as it could increase knowledge, attitudes, awareness, behavior change, intention to change, and help-seeking for gambling cravings. Further research is required to refine the intervention and examine its effectiveness with gamblers.},

The current randomized controlled trial evaluated whether an ACT app that tailored skill coaching based on in-the-moment ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) would be more efficacious than the same app where skill coaching was random or an EMA-only condition. A sample of 69 adults interested in using a self-help app were randomized to one of three app conditions and used the app for the following 4 weeks. Results indicated equivalently high user satisfaction with the tailored versus random apps. Participants used the EMA-only app the most and the tailored app the least, but overall adherence was adequate. Participants in the tailored app improved significantly more on psychological distress and positive mental health relative to the random app and EMA-only conditions. However, no differences were found between the random app and EMA-only conditions on outcomes. Between-group differences over time were also found on psychological inflexibility, but this appeared to be primarily due to a lower rate of improvement in the random app condition relative to both tailored and EMA-only. Overall, these results suggest that tailoring ACT skill coaching based on in-the-moment variables leads to greater efficacy.},

However, the potential to combine innovative HCI designs with the theoretical grounding and state-of-art interventions from psychology has yet to be fully realised. In this paper, we synthesise HCI work on emotion regulation interventions and propose a three-part framework to guide technology designers in making: (i) theory-informed decisions about intervention targets; (ii) strategic decisions regarding the technology-enabled intervention mechanisms to be included in the system; and (iii) practical decisions around previous implementations of the selected intervention components. We show how this framework can both systematise HCI work to date and suggest a research agenda for future work.},

Authors hypothesized that participants would recognize that behaviors can be flexible in form and function and respond in an ACT process-aligned manner.

Methods
Mixed-methods analyses were performed on open-ended responses collected from initial participants (n = 49) in two parallel micro-randomized trials with: 1) first-generation college students (FGCSs) (n = 25) from a four-year public research university and 2) individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BP) (n = 24). Twice each day over six weeks, participants responded to questions about mood and behavior, after which they had a 50-50 chance of receiving an ACT-based intervention. Participants identified current behavior and categorized behavior as values-based or avoidant. Interventions were selected randomly from 84 possible prompts, each targeting one ACT process: engagement with values, openness to internal experiences, or self-awareness. Participants were randomly assigned to either exploratory (10 FGCS, 9 BP) or confirmatory (15 FGCS, 15 BP) groups for analyses. Responses from the exploratory group were used to inductively derive a qualitative coding system. This system was used to code responses in the confirmatory group. Coded confirmatory data were used for final analyses.

Results
Over 50\% of participants in both cohorts submitted a non-blank response 100\% of the time. For over 50\% of participants, intervention responses aligned with the target ACT process for at least 96\% of the time (FGCS) and 91\% of the time (BP), and current behavior was labeled as values-based 70\% (FGCS) and 85\% (BP) of the time. Participants labeled similar behaviors flexibly as either values-based or avoidant in different contexts. Dominant themes were needs-based behaviors, interpersonal and family relationships, education, and time as a cost.

Conclusions
Both cohorts were engaged with the app, as demonstrated by responses that aligned with ACT processes. This suggests that participants had some level of understanding that behavior can be flexible in form and function.},

HEATH, Royal Holloway University of London, UK A successful digital society is, in part, predicated on people having secure access to digitally-delivered services when they need it. It has long been recognised that parts of society are not able to access digital services without assistance, often as a result of economic precarity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of third and voluntary sector organisations in providing assisted digital access has come to the fore. As access to essential everyday services moved to digital-only and family and friendship networks of support became disrupted by the pandemic, for many, voluntary and third sector organisations were the source of digital assistance to claim welfare, pay bills, take part in education and purchase food. Our study explores the types of assisted digital access that voluntary and third sector organisations have provided thus far during the COVID-19 pandemic. We capture the dimensions of this assistance and evaluate the steps such organisations take to ensure that this access is safe for both the assister and assisted. From these findings we set out a security strategy with supporting design principles that combines digital security with human security in a security approach we term ’positive-first’.

During this time, compulsive buying has been studied by researchers from a range of disciplines, and through a number of different research techniques. What has emerged is a realization that this problem can stem from a variety of causes and may take on several different forms. This is consistent with research across a number of various addictive or excessive behaviors that suggest that, each disorder can serve many different functions for different individuals or even for a single person (Orford 1985).},

	abstract = {Does the real or imagined presence of friends invariantly drive consumers to engage in disinhibited behavior, and give in to the “urge to splurge” in the face of consumption temptations? Or might there be situations in which being with friends or even merely thinking of friends or the friendships we have with them can actually improve self-control? In five studies, using a unique combination of controlled experiments examining overt consumer behavior and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we propose and show that the extent to which consumers identify a goal conflict between giving in to buying temptations on the one hand and the perceived consequences for maintaining satisfactory relationships with close friends on the other is a critical mediator of whether friendship reminders decrease or increase self-control. We further show that such a goal conflict is most likely for consumers with a chronic, compulsive tendency for uncontrolled, disinhibited acquisition and consumption—for consumers classified as compulsive buyers. For their non-compulsive counterparts, in contrast, acts of acquisition and consumption, even incidental disinhibited ones, are perceived to be less problematic in light of their friendships and hence do not induce a goal conflict to the same extent. Our findings provide insights into social influences on self-control and identify the concept of friendship reminders as a way to reduce a common type of dysfunctional consumer behavior. In addition to enhancing consumer well-being, reducing compulsive buying will substantially reduce handling costs for organizations. Hence, the findings are of academic, societal and managerial relevance.},

When a customer makes such impulsive purchases, it is usually motivated by emotions and feelings. This study dives into the factors that lead to impulsive purchases. The study showcases insights from 118 individuals and their views on different situations which go alongside in the flow of an impulsive purchase.

If-then plans, which can automate action control, may, thus, help regulate peer influence. This research extends existing literature explicating the deliberate influence of social norms. Design/methodology/approach Study 1 (N = 120) obtained causal evidence that forming an implementation intention (i.e. an if-then plan designed to automate action control) reduces peer impact on impulse buying in a laboratory experiment with young adults (students) selecting food items. Study 2 (N = 686) obtained correlational evidence for the role of norms, automaticity and implementation intentions in impulse buying using a large sample of high-school adolescents working on a vignette about clothes-shopping. Findings If-then plans reduced impulse purchases in the laboratory (Study 1). Both reported deliberation on peer norms and the reported automaticity of shopping with peers predicted impulse buying but an implementation intention to be thriftily reduced these links (Study 2). Research limitations/implications This research highlights the role of automatic social processes in problematic consumer behaviour. Promising field studies and neuropsychological experiments are discussed. Practical implications Young consumers can gain control over automatic peer influence by using if-then plans, thereby reducing impulse buying. Originality/value This research helps understand new precursors of impulse buying in understudied European samples of young consumers.},

Current diagnostic classifications approach this complex phenomenon using syndromatic definitions based on presence or absence of a restricted set of signs or symptoms that have demonstrated low specificity. One of the several utilities of the phenomenological method in psychiatry is to complement the clinical panorama, helping in the process of identifying potential differences between two separated clinical syndromes. The main objective of this publication is to explore one particular clinical difference between these two conditions – that is, the experience of self-continuity and time perception. Methods the argument explored in this paper is based on previous second-person or phenomenological accounts of sufferers of both conditions. Results and Conclusions Whereas borderline personality disorder patients tend to experience only the present moment, referring frequent difficulties of drawing experiences of the past in order to determine their own future, bipolar disorder patients are constantly worried about the contradictions in their past experiences and the latent risk of losing control of themselves in future episodes of their disease. This contrast should be, however, corroborated in future research comparing directly the two groups in terms of the continuity of the self and their temporal structures.},

	abstract = {Background: Given gaps in the treatment of mental health, brief adaptive interventions have become a public health imperative. Transdiagnostic interventions may be particularly appropriate given high rates of medical comorbidity and the broader reach of transdiagnostic therapies. One such approach utilized herein is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), which is focused on increasing engagement with values, awareness, and openness to internal experiences. ACT theory posits that experiential avoidance is at the center of human suffering, regardless of diagnosis, and, as such, seeks to reduce unworkable experiential avoidance.
Objective: Our objective is to provide the rationale and protocol for examining the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of optimizing an ACT-based intervention via a mobile app among two disparate samples, which differ in sociodemographic characteristics and symptom profiles.
Methods: Twice each day, participants are prompted via a mobile app to complete assessments of mood and activity and are then randomly assigned to an ACT-based intervention or not. These interventions are questions regarding engagement with values, awareness, and openness to internal experiences. Participant responses are recorded. Analyses will examine completion of assessments, change in symptoms from baseline assessment, and proximal change in mood and activity. A primary outcome of interest is proximal change in activity (eg, form and function of behavior and energy consumed by avoidance and values-based behavior) following interventions as a function of time, symptoms, and behavior, where we hypothesize that participants will focus more energy on values-based behaviors. Analyses will be conducted using a weighted and centered least squares approach. Two samples will run concurrently to assess the capacity of optimizing mobile ACT in populations that differ widely in their clinical presentation and sociodemographic characteristics: individuals with bipolar disorder (n=30) and distressed first-generation college students (n=50).
Results: Recruitment began on September 10, 2019, for the bipolar sample and on October 5, 2019, for the college sample. Participation in the study began on October 18, 2019.
Conclusions: This study examines an ACT-based intervention among two disparate samples. Should ACT demonstrate feasibility and preliminary effectiveness in each sample, a large randomized controlled trial applying ACT across diagnoses and demographics would be indicated. The public health implications of such an approach may be far-reaching.},

This is due to a breakdown of asymptotic results, boundary issues, and visible patterns in residual plots that are introduced by the model ﬁtting process. Some of these issues are well known and adjustments have been proposed. Working with LME models typically requires that the analyst keeps track of all the special circumstances that may arise. In this paper we illustrate a simpler but generally applicable approach to diagnosing LME models. We explain how to use new visual inference methods for these purposes. The approach provides a uniﬁed framework for diagnosing LME ﬁts and for model selection. We illustrate the use of this approach on several commonly available data sets. A large-scale Amazon Turk study was used to validate the methods. R code is provided for the analyses.},

	abstract = {Objective:

Psychiatric advance directives (PADs) are documents that allow users of mental health services to express their preferences for treatment in future mental health crises. To increase the use of PADs in psychiatric practice, it is helpful to consider how service users view PADs and the factors that facilitate or hinder PAD creation and implementation. A systematic review of the empirical literature on this topic may help inform evidence-based policy making.

Methods:

A systematic review concordant with PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Relevant electronic databases were searched up to July 2, 2021. Articles containing original empirical data on service users’ perspectives on PADs were included. Data were analyzed thematically, tabulated, and narratively synthesized.

Results:

Fifty-three articles were identified and included. The following categories were identified: general preferences regarding factors such as legal force and revocability; benefits of PADs at the personal, treatment-related, and social levels; challenges and barriers concerning PAD creation and application; and possible and experienced facilitators of PAD creation.

Conclusions:

Users of mental health services are highly interested in PADs and regard them as tools to improve their involvement in care. They generally prefer legally binding PADs that can be revoked only when users are competent to consent. Barriers reported by service users were mainly related to the creation and application of PADs, and support in PAD creation was the most important facilitator identified. The involvement of mental health professionals in creating PADs appears essential to realize the benefits of PADs and to reduce barriers to their use.},

	abstract = {Background: Mental health is a complex condition, highly related to emotion. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant spike in depression (from isolation) and anxiety (event related). Mobile Health (mHealth) and telemedicine offer solutions to augment patient care, provide education, improve symptoms of depression, and assuage fears and anxiety.
Objective: This review aims to assess the effectiveness of mHealth to provide mental health care by analyzing articles published in the last year in peer-reviewed, academic journals using strong methodology (randomized controlled trial).
Methods: We queried 4 databases (PubMed, CINAHL [Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature], Web of Science, and ScienceDirect) using a standard Boolean search string. We conducted this systematic literature review in accordance with the Kruse protocol and reported it in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) 2020 checklist (n=33).
Results: A total of 4 interventions (mostly mHealth) from 14 countries identified improvements in primary outcomes of depression and anxiety as well as in several secondary outcomes, namely, quality of life, mental well-being, cognitive flexibility, distress, sleep, self-efficacy, anger, decision conflict, decision regret, digestive disturbance, pain, and medication adherence.
Conclusions: mHealth interventions can provide education, treatment augmentation, and serve as the primary modality in mental health care. The mHealth modality should be carefully considered when evaluating modes of care.

	abstract = {Background: Smartphone self-monitoring of mood, symptoms, and contextual factors through ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides insights into the daily lives of people undergoing psychiatric treatment. Therefore, EMA has the potential to improve their care. To integrate EMA into treatment, a clinical tool that helps clients and clinicians create personalized EMA diaries and interpret the gathered data is needed.
Objective: This study aimed to develop a web-based application for personalized EMA in specialized psychiatric care in close collaboration with all stakeholders (ie, clients, clinicians, researchers, and software developers).
Methods: The participants were 52 clients with mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders and 45 clinicians (psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses). We engaged them in interviews, focus groups, and usability sessions to determine the requirements for an EMA web application and repeatedly obtained feedback on iteratively improved high-fidelity EMA web application prototypes. We used human-centered design principles to determine important requirements for the web application and designed high-fidelity prototypes that were continuously re-evaluated and adapted.
Results: The iterative development process resulted in Personalized Treatment by Real-time Assessment (PETRA), which is a scientifically grounded web application for the integration of personalized EMA in Dutch clinical care. PETRA includes a decision aid to support clients and clinicians with constructing personalized EMA diaries, an EMA diary item repository, an SMS text message–based diary delivery system, and a feedback module for visualizing the gathered EMA data. PETRA is integrated into electronic health record systems to ensure ease of use and sustainable integration in clinical care and adheres to privacy regulations.
Conclusions: PETRA was built to fulfill the needs of clients and clinicians for a user-friendly and personalized EMA tool embedded in routine psychiatric care. PETRA is unique in this codevelopment process, its extensive but user-friendly personalization options, its integration into electronic health record systems, its transdiagnostic focus, and its strong scientific foundation in the design of EMA diaries and feedback. The clinical effectiveness of integrating personalized diaries via PETRA into care requires further research. As such, PETRA paves the way for a systematic investigation of the utility of personalized EMA for routine mental health care.},

Stress or reduced medication adherence can lead to rapid worsening of symptoms and behaviors. Illness exacerbations and relapses generally occur with little or no clinician awareness in real time, leaving limited opportunity to modify treatments. Previous research suggests that passive mobile sensing may be beneficial for individuals with SMI by helping them monitor mental health status and behaviors, and quickly detect worsening mental health for prompt assessment and intervention. However, there is too little research on its feasibility and acceptability and the extent to which passive data can predict changes in behaviors or symptoms.},

	abstract = {Mental health problems are common and pose a tremendous societal burden in terms of cost, morbidity, quality of life, and mortality. The great majority of people experience barriers that prevent access to treatment, aggravated by a lack of mental health specialists. Digital mental health is potentially useful in meeting the treatment needs of large numbers of people. A growing number of efficacy trials have shown strong outcomes for digital mental health treatments. Yet despite their positive findings, there are very few examples of successful implementations and many failures. Although the research-to-practice gap is not unique to digital mental health, the inclusion of technology poses unique challenges. We outline some of the reasons for this gap and propose a collection of methods that can result in sustainable digital mental health interventions. These methods draw from human-computer interaction and implementation science and are integrated into an Accelerated Creation-to-Sustainment (ACTS) model. The ACTS model uses an iterative process that includes 2 basic functions (design and evaluate) across 3 general phases (Create, Trial, and Sustain). The ultimate goal in using the ACTS model is to produce a functioning technology-enabled service (TES) that is sustainable in a real-world treatment setting. We emphasize the importance of the service component because evidence from both research and practice has suggested that human touch is a critical ingredient in the most efficacious and used digital mental health treatments. The Create phase results in at least a minimally viable TES and an implementation blueprint. The Trial phase requires evaluation of both effectiveness and implementation while allowing optimization and continuous quality improvement of the TES and implementation plan. Finally, the Sustainment phase involves the withdrawal of research or donor support, while leaving a functioning, continuously improving TES in place. The ACTS model is a step toward bringing implementation and sustainment into the design and evaluation of TESs, public health into clinical research, research into clinics, and treatment into the lives of our patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa (BN) is most effective when patients demonstrate adequate skill utilization (ie, the frequency with which a patient practices or uses therapeutic skills) and skill acquisition (ie, the ability to successfully perform a skill learned in treatment). However, rates of utilization and acquisition of key treatment skills (eg, regular eating, urge management skills, and mood management skills) by the end of the treatment are frequently low; as a result, outcomes from CBT for BN are affected. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) may improve skill acquisition and utilization by delivering real-time interventions during algorithm-identified opportunities for skill practice.
Objective: In this manuscript, we describe a newly developed JITAI system called CBT+ that is designed to facilitate the acquisition and utilization of CBT for BN treatment skills when used as a treatment augmentation. We also present feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes data from a small proof-of-concept pilot trial (n=5 patients and n=3 clinicians) designed to identify opportunities for iterative development of CBT+ ahead of a larger ongoing randomized controlled trial.
Methods: A total of 5 individuals with BN received 16 sessions of outpatient CBT for BN while using the CBT+ app. Data were collected from patients and clinicians to evaluate the feasibility (eg, app use and user adherence), acceptability (eg, qualitative patient and clinician feedback, including usefulness ratings of CBT+ on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1=extremely useless to 6=extremely useful), and preliminary outcomes (eg, improvements in skill utilization and acquisition and BN symptoms) of the CBT+ system.
Results: Patients reported that CBT+ was a relatively low burden (eg, quick and easy-to-use self-monitoring interface), and adherence to in-app self-monitoring was high (mean entries per day 3.13, SD 1.03). JITAIs were perceived as useful by both patients (median rating 5/6) and clinicians (median rating 5/6) for encouraging the use of CBT skills. Large improvements in CBT skills and clinically significant reductions in BN symptoms were observed post treatment. Although preliminary findings indicated that the CBT+ system was acceptable to most patients and clinicians, the overall study dropout was relatively high (ie, 2/5, 40\% patients), which could indicate some moderate concerns regarding feasibility.
Conclusions: CBT+, the first-ever JITAI system designed to facilitate the acquisition and utilization of CBT for BN treatment skills when used as a treatment augmentation, was shown to be feasible and acceptable. The results indicate that the CBT+ system should be subjected to more rigorous evaluations with larger samples and should be considered for wider implementation if found effective. Areas for iterative improvement of the CBT+ system ahead of a randomized controlled trial are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Health researchers are increasingly using natural language processing (NLP) to study various mental health conditions using both social media and electronic health records (EHRs). There is currently no published synthesis that relates specifically to the use of NLP methods for bipolar disorder, and this scoping review was conducted to synthesize valuable insights that have been presented in the literature.
Objective: This scoping review explored how NLP methods have been used in research to better understand bipolar disorder and identify opportunities for further use of these methods.
Methods: A systematic, computerized search of index and free-text terms related to bipolar disorder and NLP was conducted using 5 databases and 1 anthology: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Academic Search Ultimate, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and the ACL Anthology.
Results: Of 507 identified studies, a total of 35 (6.9\%) studies met the inclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis was used to describe the data, and the studies were grouped into four objectives: prediction and classification (n=25), characterization of the language of bipolar disorder (n=13), use of EHRs to measure health outcomes (n=3), and use of EHRs for phenotyping (n=2). Ethical considerations were reported in 60\% (21/35) of the studies.
Conclusions: The current literature demonstrates how language analysis can be used to assist in and improve the provision of care for people living with bipolar disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder and the medical community could benefit from research that uses NLP to investigate risk-taking, web-based services, social and occupational functioning, and the representation of gender in bipolar disorder populations on the web. Future research that implements NLP methods to study bipolar disorder should be governed by ethical principles, and any decisions regarding the collection and sharing of data sets should ultimately be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the risk to the data participants and whether their privacy can be ensured.},

	abstract = {Background: Remote measurement technologies (RMT) such as mobile health devices and apps are increasingly used by those living with chronic neurological and mental health conditions. RMT enables real-world data collection and regular feedback, providing users with insights about their own conditions. Data visualizations are an integral part of RMT, although little is known about visualization design preferences from the perspectives of those living with chronic conditions.
Objective: The aim of this review was to explore the experiences and preferences of individuals with chronic neurological and mental health conditions on data visualizations derived from RMT to manage health.
Methods: In this systematic review, we searched peer-reviewed literature and conference proceedings (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, EMBASE, Web of Science, Association for Computing Machinery Computer-Human Interface proceedings, and the Cochrane Library) for original papers published between January 2007 and September 2021 that reported perspectives on data visualization of people living with chronic neurological and mental health conditions. Two reviewers independently screened each abstract and full-text article, with disagreements resolved through discussion. Studies were critically appraised, and extracted data underwent thematic synthesis.
Results: We identified 35 eligible publications from 31 studies representing 12 conditions. Coded data coalesced into 3 themes: desire for data visualization, impact of visualizations on condition management, and visualization design considerations. Data visualizations were viewed as an integral part of users’ experiences with RMT, impacting satisfaction and engagement. However, user preferences were diverse and often conflicting both between and within conditions.
Conclusions: When used effectively, data visualizations are valuable, engaging components of RMT. They can provide structure and insight, allowing individuals to manage their own health more effectively. However, visualizations are not “one-size-fits-all,”},

	abstract = {Background: Digital mental health interventions have a great potential to alleviate mental illness and increase access to care. However, these technologies face significant challenges, especially in terms of user engagement and adoption. It has been suggested that this issue stems from a lack of user perspective in the development process; accordingly, several human-centered design approaches have been developed over the years to consider this important aspect. Yet, few human-centered design approaches to digital solutions exist in the field of mental health, and rarely are end users involved in their development.
Objective: The main objective of this literature review is to understand how human-centered design is considered in e-mental health intervention research.
Methods: An exploratory mapping review was conducted of mental health journals with the explicit scope of covering e-mental health technology. The human-centered design approaches reported and the core elements of design activity (ie, object, context, design process, and actors involved) were examined among the eligible studies.
Results: A total of 30 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 22 mentioned using human-centered design approaches or specific design methods in the development of an e-mental health solution. Reported approaches were classified as participatory design (11/27, 41\%), codesign (6/27, 22\%), user-centered design (5/27, 19\%), or a specific design method (5/27, 19\%). Just over half (15/27, 56\%) of the approaches mentioned were supported by references. End users were involved in each study to some extent but not necessarily in designing. About 27\% (8/30) of all the included studies explicitly mentioned the presence of designers on their team.
Conclusions: Our results show that some attempts have indeed been made to integrate human-centered design approaches into digital mental health technology development. However, these attempts rely very little on designers and design research. Researchers from other domains and technology developers would be wise to learn the underpinnings of human-centered design methods before selecting one over another. Inviting designers for assistance when implementing a particular approach would also be beneficial. To further motivate interest in and use of human-centered design principles in the world of e-mental health, we make nine suggestions for better reporting of human-centered design approaches in future research.},

Mobile apps have the potential to help engage and support people in their therapy. We developed Pocket Skills, a mobile web app based on Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Pocket Skills teaches DBT via a conversational agent modeled on Marsha Linehan, who developed DBT. We examined the feasibility of Pocket Skills in a 4-week field study with 73 individuals enrolled in psychotherapy. After the study, participants reported decreased depression and anxiety and increased DBT skills use. We present a model based on qualitative findings of how Pocket Skills supported DBT. Pocket Skills helped participants engage in their DBT and practice and implement skills in their environmental context, which enabled them to see the results of using their DBT skills and increase their self-efficacy. We discuss the design implications of these findings for future mobile mental health systems.},

The survey contained quantitative and qualitative questions regarding technology use, current use of disorder-management apps, types of apps desired for disorder management, and app features that users would consider important when selecting apps. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.Results:Almost all participants used a smartphone daily and 40\% currently used apps for disorder management. Of those not currently using apps, 79\% indicated they would like to try them. On average, participants rated 61\% of the self-management strategies listed as desirable for app support, with sleep-management, understanding early warning signs and triggers, and stay-well plans the most frequently endorsed. App features considered important during app selection were ease-of-use, scientific quality, flexibility/customisation, and data privacy.Conclusions:The results indicate that young adults with bipolar disorder are interested in a wide range of apps for self-management. Participants were interested in apps to support self-management strategies considered clinically important for disorder management. Many of these app needs are currently unmet. Results suggest diversifying and prioritising app capabilities to ensure evidence-based resources for a broader range of app functions are available to consumers.},

	abstract = {Background
Self-management (SM) is increasingly emphasised as a key aspect of bipolar disorder (BD) treatment. However, little is known about the subjective experience of SM, which might have both positive and negative impacts. The present study aimed to advance this literature through qualitative investigation of the experiences of people with BD who participated in an SM intervention targeting quality of life (QoL).
Methods
Forty-three individuals with BD engaged with an SM intervention and were later questioned about personal experiences of engagement with the intervention, including attempts to enact self-management strategies. Thematic analysis was used to identify important aspects of the experience of SM in BD.
Results
Four themes describing people's experiences of SM were identified: 1) SM for BD is empowering, 2) individual responsibility to self-manage BD, 3) SM strategies lack power to control BD, and 4) the relationship of SM to the healthcare system.
Limitations
Potential limitations to generalisability may occur from self-selection bias in favour of SM and the QoL-focused nature of the present intervention.
Conclusions
The findings of this research generate novel insights into ways in which individuals with BD engage with SM interventions. For most people with BD, SM invokes a sense of empowerment and responsibility, although some feel symptoms remain beyond their control. A sense of partnership between consumers and clinicians may emerge from attention to SM, but traditional medical approaches were perceived as neglecting this aspect of care. Considerations from consumer perspectives are presented to assist clinicians and researchers utilising SM interventions in BD.},

	abstract = {Background: Quality of life (QoL) is increasingly being recognized as a key outcome of interventions for bipolar disorder (BD). Mobile phone apps can increase access to evidence-based self-management strategies and provide real-time support. However, although individuals with lived experiences desire support with monitoring and improving broader health domains, existing BD apps largely target mood symptoms only. Further, evidence from the broader mobile health (mHealth) literature has shown that the desires and goals of end users are not adequately considered during app development, and as a result, engagement with mental health apps is suboptimal. To capitalize on the potential of apps to optimize wellness in BD, there is a need for interventions developed in consultation with real-world users designed to support QoL self-monitoring and self-management.
Objective: This mixed methods pilot study was designed to evaluate the alpha version of the newly developed PolarUs app, developed to support QoL self-monitoring and self-management in people with BD. Co-designed using a community-based participatory research framework, the PolarUs app builds on the web-based adaptation of a BD-specific QoL self-assessment measure and integrates material from a web-based portal providing information on evidence-informed self-management strategies in BD. The primary objectives of this project were to evaluate PolarUs app feasibility (via behavioral use metrics), the impact of PolarUs (via the Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder scale, our primary outcome measure), and explore engagement with the PolarUs app (via quantitative and qualitative methods).
Methods: Participants will be residents of North America (N=150), aged {\textgreater}18 years, with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision diagnosis of BD type 1, BD type 2, or BD not otherwise specified as assessed by structured diagnostic interview. An embedded mixed methods research design will be adopted; qualitative interviews with a purposefully selected subsample (approximately, n=30) of participants will be conducted to explore in more depth feasibility, impact, and engagement with the PolarUs app over the 12-week study period.
Results: At the time of publication of this protocol, the development of the alpha version of the PolarUs app was complete. Participant enrollment has begun in June 2022. Data collection is expected to be completed by December 2022.
Conclusions: Beyond contributing knowledge on the feasibility and impact of a novel app to support QoL and self-management in BD, this study will also provide new insights related to engagement with mHealth apps. Furthermore, it will function as a case study of successful co-design between people with BD, health care providers, and BD researchers, providing a template for the},

	abstract = {Background: When the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures were instituted, the wide-scale necessity for remote mental health care increased among professional clinicians, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and certified peer support (CPS) specialists. Factors contributing to increased demand include concern for the safety of loved ones, the safety of oneself, overall well-being, unemployment, and loneliness for older individuals. While demand continues to increase and a shortage of mental health professionals persists, understanding the training, technology, media, and delivery of digital peer support services can facilitate community-based support services to assist patients in coping with mental health symptoms between clinical encounters with licensed professionals. Digital peer support consists of asynchronous and synchronous, live or automated, peer support services such as applications, social media, and phone calls.
Objective: The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine how digital peer support is delivered, by which technologies it is delivered, and how certified digital peer supporters are trained within the United States to inform future delivery of digital peer support.
Methods: We used an online cross-sectional self-report survey developed alongside certified peer specialists. The study included questions regarding the types of peer support training and the delivery methods used within their practices. We advertised the survey through a certified peer support specialist listserve, Facebook, and Twitter.
Results: Certified peer specialists provide mutual social emotional support to those with a similar mental health condition. Of certified peer specialists trained in CPS, the majority of CPS specialists were trained in peer support (418/426, 98.1\%). Peer support specialists deliver services via telephone calls (182/293, 62.1\%), via videoconference-based services (160/293, 54.6\%), via SMS text messages (123/293, 42\%), via smartphone apps (68/293, 23.2\%), and via social media (65/293, 22.2\%). Certified peer specialists deliver services through virtual reality (11/293, 3.8\%) and through video games (6/293, 2\%). Virtual reality and video games may represent emerging technologies to develop and deliver community-based support.
Conclusions: This study examined the modes of digital peer support intervention as well as the training and demographic background of peer supporters. Given the demand for mental health care, digital peer support emerges as one option to increase access. These results suggest that CPS specialists commonly use SMS text messaging, phone calls, and videoconferences to engage in peer support. Less frequently, they may use diverse modes such as apps, social media, and video games. It is important to consider the backgrounds of peer supporters and the mediums of communication to best accommodate areas where access to peer support is emerging. Larger longitudinal studies and a variety of experimental designs may be considered to understand the efficacy of digital interventions and digital peer support training to direct optimal care.},

	abstract = {Individuals can feel more motivated to change health behaviour when perceiving autonomy-support, as induced through non-pressuring message phrasing and the provision of choice: autonomy-supportive message framing. Additionally, controlling message phrasing – commands that do not provide choice – can thwart autonomy and lead to reactance, which is detrimental to the persuasiveness of health messages. Many health messages have not been formulated in an autonomysupportive manner and therefore could arouse reactance, resulting in reduced intervention effectiveness. We aimed to test the effects of autonomy-supportive vs. controlling alcohol reduction message frames on individuals’ perceived autonomysupport from these messages; and their reactance towards the message while considering the individual need for autonomy in the context of an online computer-tailored alcohol reduction intervention. A 2 (autonomy-supportive language vs. controlling language) Â 2 (choice vs. no choice) between-subjects experiment (N ¼ 521) was conducted using an online computer-tailored alcohol reduction intervention. Outcome measures were perceived autonomy-support and reactance and we investigated whether an individual’s need for autonomy moderated the effect of autonomy-supportive and controlling message frames on those outcome variables. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that neither autonomy-supportive nor controlling message frames had significant effects on perceived autonomy-support or reactance, and there was no moderation from the need for autonomy. Overall, participants evaluated the intervention as positive and perceived high levels of autonomy-support, regardless of the message frame used. Future research needs to test whether the positive intervention evaluation is due to content tailoring, and whether more distinguishable manipulations of message frames could be effective.},

METHODS: Describe specific mechanisms through which tailored health communication can enhance message relevance and identify situations in which the use of tailoring is most appropriate.
RESULTS: Overall, tailored messages appear to stimulate greater cognitive activity than do messages that are not tailored. However, non-tailored messages that happen to be a good fit for a given individual also have similar effects.
CONCLUSION: Health communication programs and materials that succeed in making information relevant to their intended audience will be more effective than those that do not. Tailoring is a proven approach to enhancing message relevance, but not the only approach to do so, and under many circumstances may not be the preferred choice.},

	abstract = {We conducted a 16-week randomized controlled trial in psychiatric outpatients with a lifetime diagnosis of a mood and/or anxiety disorder to measure the impact of a first-of-its-kind precision digital intervention software solution based on social rhythm regulation principles. The full intent-to-treat (ITT) sample consisted of 133 individuals, aged 18–65. An exploratory sub-sample of interest was those individuals who presented with moderately severe to severe depression at study entry (baseline PHQ-8 score ≥15; N = 28). Cue is a novel digital intervention platform that capitalizes on the smartphone's ability to continuously monitor depression-relevant behavior patterns and use each patient's behavioral data to provide timely, personalized “micro-interventions,” making this the first example of a precision digital intervention of which we are aware. Participants were randomly allocated to receive Cue plus care-as-usual or digital monitoring only plus care as usual. Within the full study and depressed-at-entry samples, we fit a mixed effects model to test for group differences in the slope of depressive symptoms over 16 weeks. To account for the non-linear trajectory with more flexibility, we also fit a mixed effects model considering week as a categorical variable and used the resulting estimates to test the group difference in PHQ change from baseline to 16 weeks. In the full sample, the group difference in the slope of PHQ-8 was negligible (Cohen's d = −0.10); however, the Cue group demonstrated significantly greater improvement from baseline to 16 weeks (p = 0.040). In the depressed-at-entry sample, we found evidence for benefit of Cue. The group difference in the slope of PHQ-8 (Cohen's d = −0.72) indicated a meaningfully more rapid rate of improvement in the intervention group than in the control group. The Cue group also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in PHQ-8 from baseline to 16 weeks (p = 0.009). We are encouraged by the size of the intervention effect in those who were acutely ill at baseline, and by the finding that across all participants, 80\% of whom were receiving pharmacotherapy, we observed significant benefit of Cue at 16 weeks of treatment. These findings suggest that a social rhythm-focused digital intervention platform may represent a useful and accessible adjunct to antidepressant treatment (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03152864?term=ellen+frank\&draw=2\&rank=3).},

The model explains how attempts at affect regulation are disturbed through the multiple and conﬂicting extreme personal meanings that are given to internal states. They prompt exaggerated efforts to enhance or exert control over internal states, which paradoxically provoke further internal state changes, thereby feeding into a vicious cycle that can maintain or exacerbate symptoms. Counterproductive attempts at control are classiﬁed as either ascent behaviours (increasing activation), or descent behaviours (decreasing activation). It is suggested that appraisals of extreme personal meaning are inﬂuenced by speciﬁc sets of beliefs about affect and its regulation, and about the self and relations with others, leading to an interaction that raises vulnerability to relapse. Pertinent literature is reviewed and found to be compatible with such a model. The clinical implications are discussed and compared to existing interventions.},

	abstract = {Background
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and disabling psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) techniques have been shown to effectively treat borderline personality disorder, a condition also marked by prominent affective disturbances. The utility of DBT techniques in treating BD has been largely unexplored. The purpose of this research was to conduct a pilot study of a DBT-based psychoeducational group (BDG) in treating euthymic, depressed, or hypomanic Bipolar I or II patients.
Methods
In this experiment, 26 adults with bipolar I or II were randomized to intervention or wait-list control groups and completed the Beck depression inventory II, mindfulness-based self-efficacy scale, and affective control scale at baseline and 12 weeks. The BDG intervention consisted of 12 weekly 90-min sessions which taught DBT skills, mindfulness techniques, and general BD psychoeducation.
Results
Using RM-ANOVA, subjects in BDG demonstrated a trend toward reduced depressive symptoms, and significant improvement in several MSES subscales indicating greater mindful awareness, and less fear toward and more control of emotional states (ACS). These findings were supported with a larger sample of patients who completed the BDG. Furthermore, group attendees had reduced emergency room visits and mental health related admissions in the six months following BDG.
Limitations
The small sample size in RCT affects power to detect between group differences. How well improvements after the12-week BDG were maintained is unknown.
Conclusions
There is preliminary evidence that DBT skills reduce depressive symptoms, improve affective control, and improve mindfulness self-efficacy in BD. Its application warrants further evaluation in larger studies.},

	abstract = {Background
Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been increasingly used as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for a few psychiatric disorders. However, few studies have investigated the efficacy of MBIs in bipolar disorder (BD).
Methods
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of MBIs as an adjunctive treatment in BD. Major electronic databases were independently searched by two authors for controlled and uncontrolled studies which examined the effects of MBIs on psychiatric symptoms in subjects with BD. Data from original studies were synthesized by using a random effects model.
Results
Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion into current meta-analysis, including three controlled studies (n=132) and nine uncontrolled studies (n=142). In within-group analysis, MBIs significantly reduced depressive (7 studies, n=100, Hedges’ g=0.58, p{\textless}0.001) and anxiety (4 studies, n=68, Hedges’ g=0.34, p=0.043) symptoms, but not manic symptoms (6 studies, n=89, Hedges’ g=0.09, p=0.488) and cognition (3 studies, n=43, Hedges’ g=0.35, p=0.171), compared to baseline. In between-group analysis (intervention group versus waiting list group, all patients with BD), MBIs did not reduce depressive (3 studies, n=132, Hedges’ g=0.46, p=0.315) or anxiety (3 studies, n=132, Hedges’ g=0.33, p=0.578) symptoms.
Limitations
Only three controlled trials compared MBIs to control conditions.
Conclusions
Our meta-analysis showed significantly beneficial effects on depressive and anxiety symptoms of BD patients in within-group analysis. However, this significance was not observed in comparison with the control groups. Further clinical trials are warranted to investigate the differences in the benefits of MBIs between treatment and control subjects.},

The purpose of this study was to assess changes in self-reported cognitive functioning in patients with bipolar disorder who participated in an open pilot trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Following MBCT, patients reported significant improvements in executive functioning, memory, and ability to initiate and complete tasks, as measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe). Changes in cognitive functioning were correlated with increases in mindful, nonjudgmental observance and awareness of thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and were not associated with decreases in depression. Improvements tended to diminish after termination of treatment, but some improvements, particularly those in executive functioning, persisted after 3 months. These results provide preliminary evidence that MBCT may be a treatment option that can be used as an adjunct to medication to improve cognitive functioning in bipolar disorder.

	abstract = {Background
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an increasingly popular treatment for major depression and anxiety disorder, but has shown inconsistent efficacy for bipolar disorder (BD). Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the general efficacy of MBCT for BD.
Methods
Ten studies were identified that fulfilled the current inclusion criteria, including three controlled and seven uncontrolled studies. The effects of MBCT on depression, anxiety, mania, stress, mindfulness ability, and emotional regulation were assessed by comparing psychometric scale scores within groups (pre- vs. post-intervention) across trials as well as between groups (control vs. MBCT) across controlled trials.
Results
Within-group comparison revealed a reduction in symptoms of depression (g = 0.37, 95\%CI = 0.09−0.64, P = 0.009) and anxiety (g = 0.45, 95\%CI =0.16−0.75, P = 0.002) following treatment compared to baseline. Stress symptoms were also significantly reduced (g = 0.39, 95\%CI = 0.09−0.69, P = 0.01), mindfulness ability (g = 0.63, 95\%CI = 0.39−0.87, P{\textless}0.00001) and emotion regulation (g = 0.62, 95\%CI=0.14−1.10, P = 0.01) were significantly improved compared to baseline. However, symptoms of mania were not alleviated (g=−0.26, 95\%CI=−1.43−0.91, P = 0.66). Subgroup analysis indicated that symptoms of depression and anxiety were still significantly improved at 3 months post-intervention (g = 0.46, 95\%CI = 0.13−0.80, P = 0.006 and g = 0.57, 95\%CI = 0.21−0.94, P = 0.002, respectively) but not at 12 months (g = 0.04, 95\%CI = −0.29−0.37, P = 0.82 and g = 0.17, 95\%CI =−0.16−0.50, P = 0.31). In between-groups analysis of controlled studies, MBCT significantly reduced depressive symptoms (g = 0.3, 95\%CI =-0.05−0.65, P = 0.09) but not anxiety symptoms (g = 0.51, 95\%CI =  −0.20−1.22, P = 0.16).
Conclusion
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appears effective for alleviation of depression and anxiety among BD patients, possibly by improving emotional regulation and mindfulness abilities. However, efficacy appears time-limited and inconsistent, necessitating additional larger-scale studies and the development of post-intervention programs for sustained efficacy.},

	abstract = {Background
Bipolar disorder is highly recurrent and rates of comorbidity are high. Studies have pointed to anxiety comorbidity as one factor associated with risk of suicide attempts and poor overall outcome. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and potential benefits of a new psychological treatment (Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy: MBCT) for people with bipolar disorder focusing on between-episode anxiety and depressive symptoms.
Methods
The study used data from a pilot randomized trial of MBCT for people with bipolar disorder in remission, focusing on between-episode anxiety and depressive symptoms. Immediate effects of MBCT versus waitlist on levels of anxiety and depression were compared between unipolar and bipolar participants.
Results
The results suggest that MBCT led to improved immediate outcomes in terms of anxiety which were specific to the bipolar group. Both bipolar and unipolar participants allocated to MBCT showed reductions in residual depressive symptoms relative to those allocated to the waitlist condition.
Limitations
Analyses were based on a small sample, limiting power. Additionally the study recruited participants with suicidal ideation or behaviour so the findings cannot immediately be generalized to individuals without these symptoms.
Conclusions
The study, although preliminary, suggests an immediate effect of MBCT on anxiety and depressive symptoms among bipolar participants with suicidal ideation or behaviour, and indicates that further research into the use of MBCT with bipolar patients may be warranted.},

Preliminary research findings have shown that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy improves anxiety and depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder. In this study, we further investigated the effects of MBCT in bipolar disorder, in a controlled fMRI study.
Method
Twenty three patients with bipolar disorder underwent neuropsychological testing and functional MRI. Sixteen of these patients were tested before and after an eight-week MBCT intervention, and seven were wait listed for training and tested at the same intervals. The results were compared with 10 healthy controls.
Results
Prior to MBCT, bipolar patients reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and symptoms of stress, scored significantly lower on a test of working memory, and showed significant BOLD signal decrease in the medial PFC during a mindfulness task, compared to healthy controls. Following MBCT, there were significant improvements in the bipolar treatment group, in measures of mindfulness, anxiety and emotion regulation, and in tests of working memory, spatial memory and verbal fluency compared to the bipolar wait list group. BOLD signal increases were noted in the medial PFC and posterior parietal lobe, in a repeat mindfulness task. A region of interest analysis revealed strong correlation between signal changes in medial PFC and increases in mindfulness.
Limitations
The small control group is a limitation in the study.
Conclusion
These data suggest that MBCT improves mindfulness and emotion regulation and reduces anxiety in bipolar disorder, corresponding to increased activations in the medial PFC, a region associated with cognitive flexibility and previously proposed as a key area of pathophysiology in the disorder.},

	abstract = {Background
Persisting high levels of relapse, morbidity and mortality in bipolar disorder (BD) in spite of first-line, evidence-based psychopharmacology has spurred development and research on adjunctive psychotherapies. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an emerging psychotherapy that has shown benefit in related and comorbid conditions such as major depressive, anxiety, and substance disorders. Furthermore, neurocognitive studies of MBCT suggest that it may have effects on some of the theorized pathophysiological processes in BD.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature review using PsychINFO and PubMed databases to identify studies reporting clinical and/or neurocognitive findings for MBCT for BD.
Results
This search revealed 13 articles. There was a wide range in methodological quality and most studies were underpowered or did not present power calculations. However, MBCT did not appear to precipitate mania, and there is preliminary evidence to support a positive effect on anxiety, residual depression, mood regulation, and broad attentional and frontal-executive control.
Limitations
As meta-analysis is not yet possible due to study heterogeneity and quality, the current review is a narrative synthesis, and therefore net effects cannot be estimated.
Conclusions
MBCT for BD holds promise, but more high-quality studies are needed in order to ascertain its clinical efficacy. Recommendations to address the limitations of the current research are made.},

	abstract = {Despite the increasing number of studies examining the effects of mindfulness interventions on symptoms associated with Bipolar Disorder (BD), the effectiveness of this type of interventions remains unclear. The aim of the present systematic review was to (i) critically review all available evidence on Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as a form of intervention for BD; (ii) discuss clinical implications of MBCT in treating patients with BD; and (iii) provide a direction for future research. The review presents findings from 13 studies (N = 429) that fulfilled the following selection criteria: (i) included BD patients; (ii) presented results separately for BD patients and control groups (where a control group was available); (iii) implemented MBCT intervention; (iv) were published in English; (v) were published in a peer reviewed journal; and (vi) reported results for adult participants. Although derived from a relatively small number of studies, results from the present review suggest that MBCT is a promising treatment in BD in conjunction with pharmacotherapy. MBCT in BD is associated with improvements in cognitive functioning and emotional regulation, reduction in symptoms of anxiety depression and mania symptoms (when participants had residual manic symptoms prior to MBCT). These, treatment gains were maintained at 12 month follow up when mindfulness was practiced for at least 3 days per week or booster sessions were included. Additionally, the present review outlined some limitations of the current literature on MBCT interventions in BD, including small study sample sizes, lack of active control groups and idiosyncratic modifications to the MBCT intervention across studies. Suggestions for future research included focusing on factors underlying treatment adherence and understanding possible adverse effects of MBCT, which could be of crucial clinical importance.},

Little is known about which specific emotion regulatory patterns may be transdiagnostic versus disorder specific, and how such patterns change as a function of current mood states.
Methods:  This preliminary investigation examined specific patterns of self-reported trait emotion regulation difficulties and mindfulness-based regulations strategies across four groups: remitted adults with bipolar I disorder (BD-remitted; n = 32), currently manic adults with bipolar I disorder (BD-manic; n = 19), remitted adults with major depressive disorder (MDD-remitted; n = 32), and healthy controls (CTL; n = 30).
Results:  All three clinical groups reported significantly greater difficulties with emotion regulation and decreased overall mindfulness-based strategies.
Conclusions:  These results suggest that increased emotion regulation difficulties, decreased mindfulness, and increased emotion-driven impulsivity may be transdiagnostic across mood disorders and states, and that impulsivity may be particularly impaired during periods of mania.},

Whereas early research in emotion regulation predominantly employed static, self-report measurement, the past decade has seen a shift in focus toward understanding the dynamic nature of regulation processes. This is reflected in recent refinements in the definition of emotion regulation that emphasize the importance of the ability to flexibly adapt regulation efforts across contexts. The latest proliferation of digital technologies employed in mental health research offers the opportunity to capture the state- and context-sensitive nature of emotion regulation. In this conceptual review, we examine the use of digital technologies (ecological momentary assessment; wearable and smartphone technology, physical activity, acoustic data, visual data, and geo-location; smart-home technology; virtual reality; social media) in the assessment of emotion regulation and describe their application to interventions. We also discuss challenges and ethical considerations and outline areas for future research.},

Although empirical study of DBT and bipolar disorder is limited, there is evidence to suggest that DBT is a promising treatment for bipolar disorder. In this study, adapted DBT products were created for bipolar disorder, and feedback on the products was elicited from five experts in the field through semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed and coded for analyses. The findings from the interviews were integrated into revised products with the intention to be used in the clinical community. Several experts reported currently using DBT for bipolar disorder treatment. We conclude that a form of DBT using adapted materials could be a promising intervention for the treatment of bipolar disorder, although more research is needed to demonstrate efficacy. Future directions include conducting randomized controlled trials on DBT and bipolar disorder, as well as testing the created product in clinical practice.},

Patients with BD are also likely to experience difficulties with executive functions and emotion regulation. The literature review states that little research has been done on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for BD, and there has not been an examination of this therapy on BD patients’ executive functions and emotion regulation. The present study addresses this absence of research with a pilot study on 60 BD patients. Participants in the intervention group received twelve 90-min sessions adapted from a standard DBT protocol for BD and the control group was on a wait-list for treatment. Participants completed measures of mental wellbeing and executive functioning at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 3 months later as a follow-up. Results showed that the intervention group improved over time, having lower scores in mania, depression, and emotion disregulation than the control group post-treatment. Further, the intervention group had higher scores in mindfulness, planning, problem-solving, and cognitive flexibility than the control group. The findings highlight that DBT, alongside prescription medication, can be an effective therapy for BD as well as leading to reduced manic and depression symptoms and improved executive functions, emotion regulation, and mindfulness.},

	abstract = {Background
Theoretical frameworks emphasise associations between interpretations and responses to affect and bipolar disorder (BD). This review (PROSPERO CRD42016043801) investigated which emotion regulation (ER) strategies have been applied to BD, are elevated in BD compared to clinical and non-clinical controls, and are associated with clinical and functional outcomes in BD
Methods
Search terms relating to emotion regulation, coping and bipolar disorder were entered into Embase, MedLine and PsycInfo. Quantitative studies investigating relationships between ER strategies and BD were eligible for this narrative synthesis
Results
A large volume of research (n = 47) investigated specific ER strategies in BD. Maladaptive strategies such as rumination and dampening were elevated in BD compared to controls and these particular strategies had a detrimental impact on outcomes such as mood symptoms. BD had a similar profile of ER strategies to unipolar depression, but there was limited comparison to other clinical groups. People with BD did not generally have deficits in using adaptive strategies, as evidenced by comparisons with controls and experimental studies
Limitations
Methodological heterogeneity and a lack of ecologically valid ER assessments
Conclusions
Empirical literature is critiqued in line with contemporary theories of BD and of emotion regulation more generally, in order to inform future research recommendations. This includes investigation of the importance of context in the impact of ER strategies, and discrepancies between trait and state use of ER strategies, particularly through experience sampling.},

ACT may possibly be beneficial for bipolar disorder (BD) with co-existing anxiety, which is associated with a poorer treatment outcome. Efforts are needed to identify suitable psychological interventions for BD and co-existing anxiety. In this open clinical trial, we included 26 patients with BD type 1 or 2 at an outpatient psychiatric unit specializing in affective disorders. The intervention consisted of a 12-session manualized group treatment that included psychoeducation, mindfulness, engaging in values-based behaviour, cognitive defusion, acceptance and relapse prevention modules. Participants completed four self-report questionnaires covering anxiety symptoms (Beck Anxiety Inventory - BAI), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory - BDI-II), quality of life (Quality of Life Inventory - QOLI) and psychological flexibility (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire - AAQ-2) before, during and after the treatment. At post-treatment, the participants reported significant improvements in all outcome measures, with large effects (Cohen’s d between 0.73 and 1.98). The mean reduction in anxiety symptoms was 45\%. At post-treatment, 96\% of the patients were classified as responders on at least one of the outcome measures. A limitation is that the trial is uncontrolled. The results suggest that ACT has the potential to be an effective treatment for BD patients with co-existing anxiety. Further randomized studies are warranted.},

The rapid growth in adoption of LMMs has been matched by a proliferation of differences in practice. Unless this diversity is recognized, and checked, the field shall reap enormous difficulties in the future when attempts are made to consolidate or synthesize research findings. Here we examine this diversity using two methods – a survey of researchers (n = 163) and a quasi-systematic review of papers using LMMs (n = 400). The survey reveals substantive concerns among psychologists using or planning to use LMMs and an absence of agreed standards. The review of papers complements the survey, showing variation in how the models are built, how effects are evaluated and, most worryingly, how models are reported. Using these data as our departure point, we present a set of best practice guidance, focusing on the reporting of LMMs. It is the authors’ intention that the paper supports a step-change in the reporting of LMMs across the psychological sciences, preventing a trajectory in which findings reported today cannot be transparently understood and used tomorrow.},

However, for effects with more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for experimental factors with more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is not informative about the source of a main effect or interaction. Because researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which condition means differ from each other, a priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before the sample means are known) between specific conditions or combinations of conditions are the appropriate way to represent such hypotheses in the statistical model. Many researchers have pointed out that contrasts should be “tested instead of, rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary ‘omnibus’ F test” (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain the mathematics underlying different kinds of contrasts (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated, polynomial, custom, nested, interaction contrasts), discuss their properties, and demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we explain the generalized inverse which is needed to compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses that are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A detailed understanding of contrast coding is crucial for successful and correct specification in linear models (including linear mixed models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far more useful confirmatory tests of experimental hypotheses than standard omnibus F-tests. Reproducible code is available from https://osf.io/7ukf6/.},

However, psychological researchers may be relatively unequipped to analyze such data, given its many characteristics and the general complexities involved in longitudinal modeling. The current paper introduces time series analysis to psychological research, an analytic domain that has been essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of variables across many diverse fields. First, the characteristics of time series data are discussed. Second, different time series modeling techniques are surveyed that can address various topics of interest to psychological researchers, including describing the pattern of change in a variable, modeling seasonal effects, assessing the immediate and long-term impact of a salient event, and forecasting future values. To illustrate these methods, an illustrative example based on online job search behavior is used throughout the paper, and a software tutorial in R for these analyses is provided in the Supplementary Materials.},

We detail how trust can fail at each step and illustrate our taxonomy with two case studies. Finally, we describe a wide variety of methods that can be used to increase trust at each step of our taxonomy. The use of our taxonomy highlights not only steps where existing research work on trust tends to concentrate and but also steps where building trust is particularly challenging.},

In this paper, we outline and explore the limits of a specific ethical phenomenon known as "dark patterns," where user value is supplanted in favor of shareholder value. We assembled a corpus of examples of practitioner-identified dark patterns and performed a content analysis to determine the ethical concerns contained in these examples. This analysis revealed a wide range of ethical issues raised by practitioners that were frequently conflated under the umbrella term of dark patterns, while also underscoring a shared concern that UX designers could easily become complicit in manipulative or unreasonably persuasive practices. We conclude with implications for the education and practice of UX designers, and a proposal for broadening research on the ethics of user experience.},

These can be objectively quantified in a vast number of ways, making them uniquely efficacious for identifying patterns within the decisions made by individuals. Although financial dysfunction is a common trait of neurological diseases, and the field of behavioral economics already utilizes psychiatric methods to solve problems found within the previously-held assumption of human rationality, financial analysis has been overlooked as a tool of psychiatry and applied clinical neurology. The fields of medicine and economics are generally not seen as having much in common among practitioners of either discipline, and for those who have considered this possibility there are valid concerns regarding the ethics of patient confidentiality with the combined use of both medical and financial data. This is a reasonably simple hurdle to overcome, however, and as the medical community accepts clinically-trained economists among their ranks brand new sets of analytical tools used for diagnoses, treatments, and research becomes available by applying well-established methods in economics to existing frameworks in psychiatry and neurology. By reversing the paradigm of behavioral economics, therein is found the field of financial psychometrics.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-eﬀects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random eﬀects structures aﬀect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for conﬁrmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random eﬀects structure justiﬁed by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random eﬀects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on withinsubjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for conﬁrmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

It is often used to determine time series similarity, classification, and to find corresponding regions between two time series.

In this paper we introduce FastDTW, an approximation of DTW that has a linear time and space complexity. FastDTW uses a multilevel approach that recursively projects a solution from a coarse resolution and refines the projected solution. We prove the linear time and space complexity of FastDTW both theoretically and empirically. We also analyze the accuracy of FastDTW compared to two other existing approximate DTW algorithms: Sakoe-Chuba Bands and Data Abstraction. Our results show a large improvement in accuracy over the existing methods.},

Eight police officers used an Oura ring to collect daily Total Sleep Time (TST) and resting Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and an EMA app for measuring demands, stress, mental exhaustion, and vigor during 15–55 weeks. Vector Autoregression (VAR) models were created and complemented by Granger causation tests and Impulse Response Function visualizations. Demands negatively predicted TST and HRV in one participant. TST negatively predicted demands, stress, and mental exhaustion in two, three, and five participants, respectively, and positively predicted vigor in five participants. HRV negatively predicted demands in two participants, and stress and mental exhaustion in one participant. Changes in HRV lasted longer than those in TST. Bidirectional associations of TST and resting HRV with stress-related outcomes were observed at a weak-to-moderate strength, but not consistently across participants. TST and resting HRV are more consistent predictors of stress-resilience in upcoming days than indicators of stress-related measures in prior days.},

	abstract = {Background: Affective states are important aspects of healthy functioning; as such, monitoring and understanding affect is necessary for the assessment and treatment of mood-based disorders. Recent advancements in wearable technologies have increased the use of such tools in detecting and accurately estimating mental states (eg, affect, mood, and stress), offering comprehensive and continuous monitoring of individuals over time.
Objective: Previous attempts to model an individual’s mental state relied on subjective measurements or the inclusion of only a few objective monitoring modalities (eg, smartphones). This study aims to investigate the capacity of monitoring affect using fully objective measurements. We conducted a comparatively long-term (12-month) study with a holistic sampling of participants’ moods, including 20 affective states.
Methods: Longitudinal physiological data (eg, sleep and heart rate), as well as daily assessments of affect, were collected using 3 modalities (ie, smartphone, watch, and ring) from 20 college students over a year. We examined the difference between the distributions of data collected from each modality along with the differences between their rates of missingness. Out of the 20 participants, 7 provided us with 200 or more days’ worth of data, and we used this for our predictive modeling setup. Distributions of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) among the 7 selected participants were observed. For predictive modeling, we assessed the performance of different machine learning models, including random forests (RFs), support vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). We also investigated the capability of each modality in predicting mood and the most important features of PA and NA RF models.
Results: RF was the best-performing model in our analysis and performed mood and stress (nervousness) prediction with {\textasciitilde}81\% and {\textasciitilde}72\% accuracy, respectively. PA models resulted in better performance compared to NA. The order of the most important modalities in predicting PA and NA was the smart ring, phone, and watch, respectively. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis showed that sleep and activity-related features were the most impactful in predicting PA and NA.
Conclusions: Generic machine learning–based affect prediction models, trained with population data, outperform existing methods, which use the individual’s historical information. Our findings indicated that our mood prediction method outperformed the existing methods. Additionally, we found that sleep and activity level were the most important features for predicting next-day PA and NA, respectively.},

Smartphone and wearable devices may offer a unique source of data to detect moment by moment changes in risk factors associated with mental disorders that overcome many of the limitations of traditional screening methods.Objective: The current study aimed to explore the extent to which data from smartphone and wearable devices could predict symptoms of depression and anxiety.Methods: A total of N = 60 adults (ages 24–68) who owned an Apple iPhone and Oura Ring were recruited online over a 2-week period. At the beginning of the study, participants installed the Delphi data acquisition app on their smartphone. The app continuously monitored participants' location (using GPS) and smartphone usage behavior (total usage time and frequency of use). The Oura Ring provided measures related to activity (step count and metabolic equivalent for task), sleep (total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset and time in bed) and heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, participants were prompted to report their daily mood (valence and arousal). Participants completed self-reported assessments of depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21) at baseline, midpoint and the end of the study.Results: Multilevel models demonstrated a significant negative association between the variability of locations visited and symptoms of depression (beta = −0.21, p = 0.037) and significant positive associations between total sleep time and depression (beta = 0.24, p = 0.023), time in bed and depression (beta = 0.26, p = 0.020), wake after sleep onset and anxiety (beta = 0.23, p = 0.035) and HRV and anxiety (beta = 0.26, p = 0.035). A combined model of smartphone and wearable features and self-reported mood provided the strongest prediction of depression.Conclusion: The current findings demonstrate that wearable devices may provide valuable sources of data in predicting symptoms of depression and anxiety, most notably data related to common measures of sleep.},

We argue that the distortions of lived time in mania exceed mere acceleration and are fundamental for manic affectivity. Mania involves radical acceleration and radical asynchronicity, which result in an instantaneous existence. People with mania rebel against the facticity of reality and suffer from an existential leap towards the future, in which the self abandons normal temporal boundaries. Excerpts from the interviews with persons with mania who experienced psychosis illustrate this phenomenon. Commenting upon disrupted circadian rhythms in mania and the role of lithium in its treatment the paper posits manic temporality as the link through which manic phenomenology and manic neurobiology intertwine.},

This study aimed to see if different types of perfectionism are linked differently to symptoms of depression in mood disorders and if there is a relationship between perfectionism and symptoms of mania in bipolar disorder. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the databases PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed to find papers which examined the relationship in clinical depression and bipolar disorder. A meta-analysis pooled the correlation effect sizes for mood symptoms severity and the severity of the perfectionism subtype. Results: Twelve papers were included in the review, with five of these being included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found statistically significant positive correlations between greater severity of depression symptoms and more severe perfectionism for the following subtypes: concern over mistakes, doubts about actions, other-oriented perfectionism, parental criticism, self-oriented perfectionism, and socially prescribed perfectionism. There was no significant relationship between depression symptoms and perfectionism subtypes of organisation and personal standards. There were not enough studies reporting data for manic symptoms for the meta-analysis or for any firm conclusions to be drawn. Conclusions: The relationship between depression and perfectionism differs depending on the particular type of perfectionism examined. Most studies were cross-sectional and correlational, so causation cannot be inferred, and future longitudinal studies are needed.},

	abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder involving recurring (hypo)manic and depressive episodes. The inherently temporal nature of BD has inspired its conceptualization using dynamical systems theory, which is a mathematical framework for understanding systems that evolve over time. In this paper, we provide a critical review of the dynamical systems models of BD. Owing to the heterogeneity of methodological and experimental designs in computational modeling, we designed a structured approach that parallels the appraisal of animal models by their face, predictive, and construct validity. This tool, the validity appraisal guide for computational models (VAG-CM), is not an absolute measure of validity, but rather a guide for a more objective appraisal of models in this review. We identified 26 studies published before November 18, 2021 that proposed generative dynamical systems models of time-varying signals in BD. Two raters independently applied the VAG-CM to the included studies, obtaining a mean Cohen’s κ of 0.55 (95\% CI [0.45, 0.64]) prior to establishing consensus ratings. Consensus VAG-CM ratings revealed three model/study clusters: data-driven models with face validity, theory-driven models with predictive validity, and theory-driven models lacking all forms of validity. We conclude that future modeling studies should employ a hybrid approach that first operationalizes BD features of interest using empirical data to achieve face validity, followed by explanations of those features using generative models with components that are homologous to physiological or psychological systems involved in BD, to achieve construct validity. Such models would be best developed alongside long-term prospective cohort studies involving a collection of multimodal time-series data. We also encourage future studies to extend, modify, and evaluate the VAG-CM approach for a wider breadth of computational modeling studies and psychiatric disorders.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/egp82},
	abstract = {Background. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic psychiatric condition characterized by large episodic changes in mood and energy. Recently, BD has been proposed to be conceptualized as chronic cyclical mood instability, as opposed to the traditional view of alternating discrete episodes with stable periods in-between. Recognizing this mood instability may improve care and calls for high-frequency measures coupled with advanced statistical models. 
Methods. To uncover empirically derived mood states, a multilevel hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to 4-month ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data in twenty patients with BD, yielding {\textasciitilde}9.820 assessments in total. EMA data comprised self-report questionnaires (5x daily) measuring manic and depressive constructs. Manic and depressive symptoms were also assessed weekly using the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale and the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report. Alignment between HMM-uncovered momentary mood states and weekly questionnaires was assessed with a multilevel linear model.
Results. HMM uncovered four mood states (euthymic, manic, mixed, and depressive) that aligned with weekly symptom scores. Mood states switched more frequently than weekly data suggested. On average, patients remained {\textless}24h in one state: average state duration was 17.1h (SD=78.0) for euthymic, 16.3h (SD=70.8) for depressive, 9.1h (SD=11.6) for manic, and 8.8h (SD=10.9) for mixed. In almost half of the patients, significant mood instability was observed. State duration and switching varied strongly between individuals.
Conclusions. The results indicate that chronic mood instability is a key feature of BD, even in “relatively” euthymic periods. This should be considered in theoretical and clinical conceptualizations of the disorder.},

In the course of disease there are episodic fluctuations between different mood phases, ranging from depression to manic episodes and mixed states. Early detection and treatment of prodromal symptoms of affective episode recurrence is crucial since it reduces the conversion rates to full-blown illness and decreases the symptoms severity. This can be achieved by monitoring the mood stability with the use of data collected from patients’ smartphones. We provide an illustrative example of the application of control charts to early and reliably generate notifications about the change of the bipolarity phase. Our charts are designed with the weighted model averaging approaches WAM* and WAMs for the detection of disturbances in the stability of the monitored processes. The models are selected in a novel way using the autocorrelation functions. The proposed approach delivers results that have clear, psychiatric interpretation. Control charts based on weighted model averaging are a promising tool for monitoring patients suffering from bipolar disorder, especially in case of limited amount of diagnostic data.},

Many approaches have been investigated, ranging from deriving new metrics to developing bag-of-words models to imaging time series to artificial neural networks. In this review, we present in detail the major contributions made to this field and mention their most prominent extensions. We dedicate a section to each category of algorithms, with an intuitive introduction on the general approach, detailed theoretical descriptions and explicit illustrations of the major contributions, and mentions of their most prominent extensions. At last, we dedicate a section to publicly available resources, namely data sets and open-source software, for time series classification. A particular emphasis is made on enumerating the availability of the mentioned algorithms in the most popular libraries.

	abstract = {Multivariate time series (MTS) arise when multiple interconnected sensors record data over time. Dealing with this high-dimensional data is challenging for every classifier for at least two aspects: First, an MTS is not only characterized by individual feature values, but also by the interplay of features in different dimensions. Second, this typically adds large amounts of irrelevant data and noise. We present our novel MTS classifier WEASEL+MUSE which addresses both challenges. WEASEL+MUSE builds a multivariate feature vector, first using a sliding-window approach applied to each dimension of the MTS, then extracts discrete features per window and dimension. The feature vector is subsequently fed through feature selection, removing non-discriminative features, and analysed by a machine learning classifier. The novelty of WEASEL+MUSE lies in its specific way of extracting and filtering multivariate features from MTS by encoding context information into each feature. Still the resulting feature set is small, yet very discriminative and useful for MTS classification. Based on a popular benchmark of 20 MTS datasets, we found that WEASEL+MUSE is among the most accurate classifiers, when compared to the state of the art. The outstanding robustness of WEASEL+MUSE is further confirmed based on motion gesture recognition data, where it out-of-the-box achieved similar accuracies as domain-specific methods.},

These algorithms involve approximating and discretising windows over a series to form words, then forming a count of words over a given dictionary. Classifiers are constructed on the resulting histograms of word counts. A 2017 evaluation of a range of time series classifiers found the bag of symbolic-Fourier approximation symbols (BOSS) ensemble the best of the dictionary based classifiers. It forms one of the components of hierarchical vote collective of transformation-based ensembles (HIVE-COTE), which represents the current state of the art. Since then, several new dictionary based algorithms have been proposed that are more accurate or more scalable (or both) than BOSS. We propose a further extension of these dictionary based classifiers that combines the best elements of the others combined with a novel approach to constructing ensemble members based on an adaptive Gaussian process model of the parameter space. We demonstrate that the Temporal Dictionary Ensemble (TDE) is more accurate than other dictionary based approaches. Furthermore, unlike the other classifiers, if we replace BOSS in HIVE-COTE with TDE, HIVE-COTE becomes significantly more accurate. We also show this new version of HIVE-COTE is significantly more accurate than the current top performing classifiers on the UCR time series archive. This advance represents a new state of the art for time series classification.},

HIVE-COTE forms its ensemble from classifiers of multiple domains, including phase-independent shapelets, bag-of-words based dictionaries and phase-dependent intervals. Since it was first proposed in 2016, the algorithm has remained state of the art for accuracy on the UCR time series classification archive. Over time it has been incrementally updated, culminating in its current state, HIVE-COTE 1.0. During this time a number of algorithms have been proposed which match the accuracy of HIVE-COTE. We propose comprehensive changes to the HIVE-COTE algorithm which significantly improve its accuracy and usability, presenting this upgrade as HIVE-COTE 2.0. We introduce two novel classifiers, the Temporal Dictionary Ensemble and Diverse Representation Canonical Interval Forest, which replace existing ensemble members. Additionally, we introduce the Arsenal, an ensemble of ROCKET classifiers as a new HIVE-COTE 2.0 constituent. We demonstrate that HIVE-COTE 2.0 is significantly more accurate on average than the current state of the art on 112 univariate UCR archive datasets and 26 multivariate UEA archive datasets.},

	abstract = {Background
Patients undergoing continuous vital sign monitoring (heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR], pulse oximetry [SpO2]) in real time display inter-related vital sign changes during situations of physiologic stress. Patterns in this physiological cross-talk could portend impending cardiorespiratory instability (CRI). Vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling with Granger causality tests is one of the most flexible ways to elucidate underlying causal mechanisms in time series data.

Purpose
The purpose of this article is to illustrate development of patient-specific VAR models using vital sign time series (VSTS) data in a sample of acutely ill, monitored, step-down unit (SDU) patients, and determine their Granger causal dynamics prior to onset of an incident CRI.

Approach
CRI was defined as vital signs beyond stipulated normality thresholds (HR = 40–140/minute, RR = 8–36/minute, SpO2 {\textless} 85\%) and persisting for 3 minutes within a 5-minute moving window (60\% of the duration of the window). A 6-hour time segment prior to onset of first CRI was chosen for time series modeling in 20 patients using a six-step procedure: (a) the uniform time series for each vital sign was assessed for stationarity; (b) appropriate lag was determined using a lag-length selection criteria; (c) the VAR model was constructed; (d) residual autocorrelation was assessed with the Lagrange Multiplier test; (e) stability of the VAR system was checked; and (f) Granger causality was evaluated in the final stable model.

Results
The primary cause of incident CRI was low SpO2 (60\% of cases), followed by out-of-range RR (30\%) and HR (10\%). Granger causality testing revealed that change in RR caused change in HR (21\%) (i.e., RR changed before HR changed) more often than change in HR causing change in RR (15\%). Similarly, changes in RR caused changes in SpO2 (15\%) more often than changes in SpO2 caused changes in RR (9\%). For HR and SpO2, changes in HR causing changes in SpO2 and changes in SpO2 causing changes in HR occurred with equal frequency (18\%).

Discussion
Within this sample of acutely ill patients who experienced a CRI event, VAR modeling indicated that RR changes tend to occur before changes in HR and SpO2. These findings suggest that contextual assessment of RR changes as the earliest sign of CRI is warranted. Use of VAR modeling may be helpful in other nursing research applications based on time series data.},

	abstract = {Mental health symptoms are commonly discovered in primary care. Yet, these settings are not set up to provide psychological treatment. Digital interventions can play a crucial role in stepped care management of patients’ symptoms where patients are offered a low intensity intervention, and treatment evolves to incorporate providers if needed. Though digital interventions often use smartphone and wearable sensor data, little is known about patients’ desires to use these data to manage mental health symptoms. In 10 interviews with patients with symptoms of depression and anxiety, we explored their: symptom self-management, current and desired use of sensor data, and comfort sharing such data with providers. Findings support the use digital interventions to manage mental health, yet they also highlight a misalignment in patient needs and current efforts to use sensors. We outline considerations for future research, including extending design thinking to wraparound services that may be necessary to truly reduce healthcare burden.},
